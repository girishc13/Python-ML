the committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided that they needed more time in particular to consider a news report which quoted a reagan administration official as urging that the proposal be given serious consideration . 
" the banks felt that this was new information and that further consultation was called for , " one banker said . 
in a despatch yesterday from washington , reuters quoted the official as saying manila ' plan to pay some interest with notes that could be converted into equity investments in the philippines was fully consistent with the reagan administration strategy for handling developing country debt . 
" the philippine proposal is very interesting , it ' quite unique and i don ' think it ' something that should be categorically rejected out of hand , " the official said .

most economists said they did not expect the fed to add reserves with federal funds trading below six pct . 
they said the funds rate ' softer tone may indicate that the need to add reserves in the current bank reserve maintenance period is smaller than previously estimated . 
fed funds opened at 5 - pct and remained at that level .

it said the bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest - factors in the economy that could affect the long - capital market . 
the inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates . 
but a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year ' end and next year , it said . 
the association said generally low interest rates , prospects of lower taxes , a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth . 
the bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short - money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long - capital market , which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy , it said . 
in view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer - capital market , the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short - and expansionist monetary policy . 
on the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987 . 
the association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short - invested domestic money would distort money supply developments . 
the bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions , it said. bank of montreal lowers credit card rate toronto , april 3 bank of montreal said it will reduce the interest rate it charges on outstanding mastercard balances to 18 pct from 21 pct , beginning in july .

" the government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy , " he told a press conference . 
his remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days . 
at the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in paris , japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand , which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus . 
sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable . 
he said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets . 
conflicting economic indicators from the u.s . 
have also been dampening market activity , he added. spain raises call money rate to 14 pct madrid , april 3 the bank of spain said it raised its rate for overnight call money to 14 pct from 14 pct with immediate effect at today ' daily auction for assistance funds . 
the move followed comments yesterday by central bank governor mariano rubio , who said money supply growth was too fast . 
the bank said later that it was leaving its rate for special assistance funds from its second window unchanged at 16 pct , surprising operators who had expected an increase there too. national savings move points to lower u.k. rates london , march 11 u.k . 
interest rates look set to move lower even after monday ' half - point cut in bank base rates to 10 - pct , analysts said , citing as evidence the suspension of a british national savings issue yesterday . 
the department of national savings , effectively a treasury department unit , yesterday suspended its 32nd issue , launched in october and paying a high tax - 8 - pct on five - private investments between 25 and 5 , stg . 
a spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market . 
the move was followed by a surprise sell - out within minutes today of a bank of england one - stg tap issue , the second such issue in as many weeks , analysts noted . 
they said the near - sale of the entire new gilts issue , for which the bank of england had required a high 40 pct downpayment , was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later . 
the sale of the tranche of 8 - pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active , bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact , with the bellwether three - interbank rate down 1 / point at 10 - pct . 
it coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four - highs against the dollar . 
" that government stock disappeared very quickly indeed , " said stephen lewis , head of economic research at stockbrokers phillips and drew " it is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further .. . 
at least by a half - immediately after the budget ( on march 17) , and some people hope for more stockbrokers james capel said in a comment the move by the national savings department was " of considerable significance it said , " the real message .. . 
is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates . 
lewis of phillips and drew said he too believed the national savings issue suspension may reflect new u.k . 
treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut . 
" national savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late . 
building society income has been depressed in recent months , " he said . 
he and other analysts said chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on u.k . 
inflation . 
underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in britain than in most other western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year ' 3 pct . 
emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices , lewis said a one - cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in britain by about 0 pct . 
but lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from national savings , which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts . 
" the chancellor need not be worried about losing some psbr funding from national savings , but he must be taking the building societies ' criticism to heart . 
it looks like the national savings move reflects this , " one senior dealer said . 
a savings department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation , saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in u.k . 
interest rates , which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market . 
" we are not politically motivated .. . 
funding was just becoming too expensive and we don ' need all that money , " he told reuters , adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past , when offered interest rates were above or below market rates . 
he said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as u.k . 
money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending march 31 . 
in the first 10 months of fiscal 1986 , national saving ' contribution to government funding totalled 2 billion stg , compared with 2 billion stg in the same period of the previous year , official figures show . 
figures for february , out on monday , are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg , pushing the total for 11 months above target , government officials said. fed sets 1 billion dlr customer repurchase , fed says fhlbb changes short - discount note rates washington , april 1 the federal home loan bank board adjusted the rates on its short - discount notes as follows maturity new rate old rate maturity 30 - days 5 pct 5 pct 30 - days 70 - days 5 pct 5 pct 125 - days 89 - days 5 pct 5 pct 151 - days 124 - days 5 pct 5 pct 174 - days 151 - days 5 pct 5 pct 183 - days 350 - days 5 pct 5 pct 350 - days security pacific , provident national lift prime new york , april 1 security pacific national bank and provident national bank said they increased their prime lending rates a quarter point to 7 - pct . 
they said the move is effective immediately. italian treasury cuts interest on certificates rome , march 1 the italian treasury said annual coupon rates payable march 1988 on two issues of long - treasury certificates ( ccts ) would be cut by about four percentage points compared with rates this march . 
coupon rates on 10 - certificates maturing march 1995 will fall to 9 pct from 13 pct and rates on 10 - issues maturing in march 1996 would fall to 10 pct from 14 pct . 
the treasury also cut by 0 point six - coupons payable this september on six issues maturing between september 1988 and september 1991 . 
the issues carry terms of between five and seven years and will have coupon rates of between 4 and 5 pct in september compared with 5 and 6 pct this march. volcker says fed policy not responsible for prime rate rise japan expected to cut base rate for state bodies tokyo , feb 27 japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5 pct from 6 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in paris , finance ministry sources said . 
they said the cut is based on a revision of the trust fund bureau law , which should be approved by parliament on march 3 , abolishing the 6 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau . 
the bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses , they said . 
the base lending rate for state bodies such as the japan development bank , people ' finance corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long - prime rates , the sources said . 
however , it was impossible for them to follow the last cut , to 5 pct from 6 pct on january 28 , because the trust fund bureau rate was legally set at 6 pct . 
the ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market - related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy , they said . 
on tuesday , the ministry allowed long - bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5 pct , effective february 28 . 
the move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau , the postal savings system of the posts and telecommunications ministry and the japan welfare annuity of the ministry of health and welfare , the sources said . 
these ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau ' deposit rate , the ministry sources said . 
coupon rates on new 10 - government bonds , minus 0 percentage points , is the likeliest choice , they added. analysts see early one point cut in u.k. base rate london , march 17 british bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9 - pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the u.k . 
central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today ' 1987 budget , bank analysts said . 
the analysts described chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson ' budget as cautious , a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward . 
sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through , the analysts said . 
lloyds merchant bank chief economist roger bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow . 
" this is very much a safety - budget in order to get interest rates down , " he said . 
bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut , with the key three month interbank rate down to 9 - pct from 9 - last night , and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half - point cut now . 
midland bank treasury economist david simmonds said he , too , expected base rates would be a full point lower by friday , but this would likely happen via two half - cuts . 
" this budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate . 
the implications for interest rates are very favourable , we could have a half - cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week , " simmonds said . 
pointing to buoyant u.k . 
retail data released yesterday , he said lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target . 
" there is no real need to boost private consumption , " he said . 
national westminster bank chief economist david kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one - base rate cut . 
kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully , in particular to see how exactly lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut , before a one - point base rate cut could be implemented . 
but providing the budget small - was convincing , " and i suspect it will be , it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week , " kern said . 
bootle of lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one - cut in mortgage lending rates . 
this would help achieve lawson ' lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987 , he said. u.k . 
base rates were cut last week to 10 - pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange , money and government bonds ( gilts ) markets . 
but building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point. indian rate cuts to spark industry , agriculture new delhi , april 1 the indian finance ministry ' announcement in parliament yesterday , changing the nation ' interest rate structure , will benefit industry and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest , bankers and brokers said . 
the changes , effective today , included reducing commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17 pct by one percentage point . 
new rates , which affect both indian and foreign banks , also include a one percentage point gain , to an annual 10 pct , on deposits of two years or more but less than five . 
bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been abolished . 
bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the government ' concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve world competitiveness of indian goods . 
there is likely to be a shift to short - bank deposits by long - depositors , bankers predicted . 
this will create the flexibility to draw and re - funds in either equity shares or short - bank deposits , they said . 
a merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market . 
tata steel , a trend setter on the bombay stock exchange , opened today higher at 1 , rupees against yesterday ' closing of 1 , rupees . 
a stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy convertible and non - debentures because the finance ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12 pct and 14 pct respectively from 13 and 15 pct respectively . 
" but overall debenture prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity , " a merchant banker said. tcf banking and savings hikes prime rate minneapolis , april 1 tcf banking and savings fa said it is raising its prime rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct effective today. anz bank in n.z. raises indicator lending rate wellington , april 3 the australia and new zealand banking group ltd in new zealand said it will raise its indicator lending rate to 23 pct from 21 pct on april 7 .

market participants are understandably nervous and cautious about future developments . 
these include flows to and from the government relating to the privatisation of seven government departments on april 1 . 
" we welcome the flexibility evident in the reserve bank ' move to raise the system cash target yesterday , but feel that to reduce the present nervousness the cash target and primary liquidity level need to be raised further he said . 
the reserve bank has raised its daily cash target to 45 mln n.z . 
dlrs from its normal 30 mln dlrs . 
call rates have traded as high as 65 pct this week because of business year - march 31 balance date book squaring .

with federal funds trading at a steady 6 - pct , most economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves via a medium - round of customer repurchase agreements . 
however , some economists said the fed may arrange more aggressive system repurchase agreements . 
economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass early this afternoon . 
such action had been widely anticipated yesterday but failed to materialize. hong kong banks raise prime one - point to 6 pct hong kong , april 4 hongkong and shanghai banking corp and standard chartered bank raised their prime rate one - point to 6 pct , effective tuesday , the association of banks said .

" i hope it was a temporary blip upward , " he told a house appropriations subcommittee . 
he said the decline in interest rates since president reagan took office remains " one of the significant accomplishments , in the economic area , of this administration top discount rate at uk bill tender 9 pct london , april 3 the top accepted rate of discount at the weekly u.k . 
treasury bill tender rose to 9 pct from 9 pct last week . 
applications at the lowest accepted price of 97 stg were allotted around 81 pct of the amount applied for , and applications above that price were allotted in full , the bank of england said . 
a total of 100 mln stg of treasury bills was offered for sale this week . 
last week , the average rate of discount was 9 pct. u.k. banks offer fixed - mortgages at 10 pct london , march 11 two major u.k . 
clearing banks announced they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a fixed interest rate of 10 pct for the first three years , below current bank base lending rates of 10 pct . 
midland bank plc mdbl said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg for home loans at this rate , while lloyds bank plc lloy will offer 300 mln stg . 
earlier this week , midland said it would cut its standard rate of mortgage payment to 11 pct from april 1 , following a half a percentage point reduction in leading banks ' base lending rates from 11 pct . 
building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level , although last year lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9 pct on certain home loans . 
a midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of 2 billion stg , its existing mortgage book accounts for about 5 pct of the total british home loan market . 
lloyds said it has 3 billion stg in outstanding mortgage loans , but had not estimated its total market share . 
among other major clearing banks , barclays plc bcs and national westminister bank plc nwbl said they had no immediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes . 
danish overnight money market rate cut to 10 pct from 10 central bank fed sets two billion dlr customer repurchase new york , march 26 the federal reserve entered the u.s. government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements , a spokeswoman for the new york fed said . 
federal funds were trading at 6 - pct at the time of the indirect injection of temporary reserves. chase manhattan raises prime rate to 7 - pct from 7-1/2 , effective today h.k. banks to raise prime rates soon , dealers say hong kong , april 1 banks in hong kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6 - pct following a one - point prime rate increase by two major u.s . 
banks yesterday , dealers said . 
they told reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend ' routine meeting of the hong kong association of banks. g.c . 
goh , chief dealer of the standard chartered bank , said prime rate increases by citibank and chase manhattan bank to 7 - pct from 7 - may prompt hong kong banks to follow suit . 
goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6 - pct , the level at beginning of 1987 . 
the banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on february 28 after cutting it 1 - points from 6 - on january 15 in response to upside pressure on the hong kong dollar , he said . 
the medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today , with three months ending at 5 - to 4 - pct against yesterday ' five to 4 - close . 
the overnight rate , however , fell to 3 - to three pct from 4 - to four because of increased liquidity for a local stock issue. analysts see slow move to higher u.s. prime rate new york , march 31 quarter - prime rate increases to 7 - pct by citibank and chase manhattan bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the federal reserve ' policy intentions , economists said . 
" based on the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate , it probably makes sense for others to follow , but no rush is likely , " said paul mcculley of e.f . 
hutton and co . 
citibank ' surprise base rate increase , quickly followed by chase , sent u.s. bond prices lower and the dollar higher . 
mcculley said that once the spread between three - certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1 - percentage points , there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase . 
it has been under 1 - points recently . 
however , banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term , analysts said . 
they noted that banks historically like to follow fed rate movements , rather than lead them . 
for example , the last prime rate increase occurred in june 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12 - pct after a fed discount rate increase in april of that year . 
major banks had been posting a 7 - pct prime rate since last august 26/27 , when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the fed ' half - discount rate cut to the current 5 - pct level on august 20 . 
" the banks will not rush to raise their prime rates . 
there should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7 - pct rate and others 7 - pct , " said david jones of aubrey g . 
lanston and co . 
jones said the federal open market committee at today ' meeting voted no change in fed policy . 
but he said the fed may well foster higher interest rates soon . 
jones said that , while the fomc probably voted no policy change today , it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens , inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery . 
" the fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today ' coupon pass , " said joseph liro of s.g . 
warburg and co . 
in a move that came a day earlier than most expected , the fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of treasury notes and bonds for its own account . 
this seasonal reserve add is called a " pass " the fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change , " said elizabeth reiners , economist at dean witter reynolds inc . 
she said the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986 . 
reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase . 
the dean witter economist said that today ' prime rate rise " may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the ( balance sheet ) bottom line reiners said that , given recent problems with loans to developing countries , large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans . 
the federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move . 
in raising their prime rates , banks cited a higher cost of funds . 
in the three business days through monday , the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6 - pct . 
but quarter end pressures helped push up funds . 
the fed funds rate was extremely volatile today , reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the japanese fiscal year . 
funds traded between five and 6 - pct . 
once the special distortions end , analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6 - pct area . 
they said that , if it stabilizes near there , banks may not quickly boost their prime rates . 
but a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar . 
then banks would lift prime rates quickly. sumita says little room for bank to ease policy tokyo , march 11 bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit . 
" the government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy , " he told a press conference .

he said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets . 
conflicting economic indicators from the u.s . 
have also been dampening market activity , he added. canada 91 - t - average 6 pct , making bank rate 7 pct sumita says bank of japan has no intention of lowering its discount rate fhlbb changes short - discount note rates washington , april 3 the federal home loan bank board adjusted the rates on its short - discount notes as follows maturity new rate old rate maturity 30 - days 5 pct 5 pct 30 - days 274 - days 5 pct 5 pct 90 - days 295 - days 5 pct 5 pct 101 - days 345 - days 5 pct 5 pct 182 - days 5 pct 196 - days 5 pct 275 - days 5 pct 296 - days manufacturers hanover raises prime rate to 7 - pct from 7-1/2 , effective today white house says interest rates reflect market washington , april 3 the white house said the rise in interest rates was " unfortunate in a general sense " but reflected market forces . 
" there ' always movement up and down and the basic fact is that we believe the economy is strong and growing and there will always be fluctuations in the interest rate , but the economy is sound and in good shape , " spokesman marlin fitzwater said . 
citibank raised its prime rate by one quarter of a point and the move was followed by other banks. corrected major swiss banks raise customer time deposit rates 1 / point to 3 - pct credit suisse japan to promote interest rate liberalisation tokyo , march 2 the bank of japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation - large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (mmcs) , a central bank official said . 
the new guideline will go into effect on april 6 , the bank said . 
under the guideline , the minimum denomination of regulation - large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln . 
the interest rate ceiling of mmcs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate , the bank said . 
but the ceiling on mmcs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same , or 0 percentage point below the cd rates . 
the minimum denomination of mmcs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln . 
the bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0 point , effective march 16 , in line with the half - cut in the official discount rate on february 23 . 
new interest rates on two - and one - deposits at banks , for example , will be 3 pct and 3 pct per annum , respectively . 
demand deposit rates , however , will remain the same . 
belgium cuts discount rate to 8 pct from 8 official gros denies court action against brazil brasilia , march 27 central bank president francisco gros denied rumours that foreign creditors had filed court actions against brazil to seek payment of its 109 - dlr debt . 
" there is no court action against brazil , " gros said in a television interview . 
brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks and yesterday suggested an extension of short - credit lines for 60 days until may 31 . 
media reports said some banks rated as small among brazil ' 700 creditors had filed lawsuits against the decision to suspend interest payments . 
gros said negotiations with the commercial creditors would start within two weeks , when he and finance minister dilson funaro attend council meetings of the international monetary fund ( imf ) in washington . 
" brazil is facing the issue very carefully . 
we are seeking a negotiation that will give the country space to grow , because only with growth will we be able to meet our commitments , " gros said. major swiss banks raise customer time deposit rates 1 / point to three pct credit suisse sallie mae adjusts short - discount note rates washington , april 3 the student loan marketing association said its rates on short - discount notes were as follows maturity new rate old rate maturity 5 - days 5 pct 5 pct 5 - days 15 - days 5 pct 5 pct 15 - days 79 - days 5 pct 5 pct 82 - days 89 - days 5 pct 5 pct 89 - days 5 pct 175 - days 5 pct 181 - days u.s. says no pact on relief for poorest states washington , april 7 there is no consensus so far among industrial countries on an agreement providing debt relief for the world ' poorest nations , a senior u.s . 
treasury official said . 
the official said , " there has not been a consensus reached yet , " when asked about reports the paris club of western creditors had agreed to long - stretch outs of african debt at concessional interest rates . 
the official , briefing reporters on this week ' semiannual imf meetings , said the issue would be discussed this week and the u.s. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to concessional interest rate relief. u.s. credit market outlook prime rate new york , april 1 the prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders citibank and chase manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today , economists said . 
bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter - increase in its prime rate to 7 - pct . 
chase manhattan quickly followed . 
prices quickly fell by a full point , even though the dollar the market ' overriding concern of late rose sharply on the news . 
citibank cited the higher cost of money , especially in the euromarket , as the reason for raising its prime rate . 
part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter federal reserve policy to defend the dollar , but economists said it is too early to tell whether the fed , whose policy - federal open market committee , fomc , meets this week , is already tightening its grip on credit . 
" the fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system ' reserve needs this statement period , but i wouldn ' conclude anything until i ' seen the fed data , " said jeffrey leeds of chemical bank. reuter canada 91 - t - average 7 pct , making bank rate 7 pct anz bank to cut australian prime rate to 18 pct melbourne , april 3 australia and new zealand banking group ltd anza said it will lower its australian prime lending rate to 18 pct from 18.25 , effective april 6 . 
the cut is the second announced by the bank in the last week , following a cut from 18 pct effective last monday . 
the anz ' new rate will be the lowest prime set by the four major trading banks and matches the rate set by one of the smaller foreign banks in january and left unchanged during the rise in primes over the last three months . 
other primes range from 18 to 18 pct , including those of the other three majors. fhlbb changes short - discount note rates washington , april 1 the federal home loan bank board adjusted the rates on its short - discount notes as follows maturity new rate old rate maturity 30 - days 5 pct 5 pct 30 - days 124 - days 5 pct 5 pct 124 - days 151 - days 5 pct 5 pct 151 - days 350 - days 5 pct 5 pct 350 - days trading range likely to continue in debt futures chicago , march 13 u.s. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake u.s. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3 - months , financial analysts said . 
" people don ' seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the federal reserve doing anything , " said drexel burnham lambert analyst norman mains . 
the narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume , he noted . 
" we ' had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people ' viewpoints on interest rates , " mains said . 
the data , which has provided not clear - view of the economy , coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the paris initiative has made for " less than ebullient market action , " mains said . 
he added , however , that treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range . 
" my view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified , " mains said . 
refco inc senior vice president michael connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest . 
" all of the movement occurs at the opening , " afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades , connery said . 
although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices , the small rise in february producer prices and downward revisions in january retail sales and industrial production were " not real exciting , " said prudential bache analyst fred leiner . 
" there is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment , " leiner said . 
next week ' revision to fourth quarter u.s . 
gross national product is also likely to be of little interest to the market , said kleinwort benson chief financial economist sam kahan . 
still , forecasts for first quarter gnp could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month . 
kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct , due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the january inventory data friday , which showed the largest increase since 1979 . 
" the key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter gnp , but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal , " kahan said . 
he said that a sizable increase in first quarter gnp stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth . 
if that is the case , gnp in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate , kahan said . 
london floating rate note prices open sharply lower , dealers say volcker says fed policy not linked to rate rise washington , april 7 federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said that he did not believe there was a connection between the fed ' policies and the recent rise in the prime interest rate by most major u.s. banks . 
asked by reporters following testimony before the senate banking committee whether the fed had anything to do with the rise to 7 - pct in the prime , he replied , " not that i was able to detect national westminster bank cuts base rate london , march 9 national westminster bank plc said it has cut its base lending rate 0 percentage points to 10 pct today . 
national westminster said it was responding to general easing in money market rates . 
its move followed a signal from the bank of england earlier this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the base rate , a surprise move following its strong signals last week that such a move would be premature . 
however , since then the pound has continued to gain strongly. first wisconsin nat ' bank hikes prime rate milwaukee , april 1 first wisconsin national bank said it has raised its prime rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct , effective today. hong kong banks leave interest rates unchanged hong kong , march 7 the hong kong association of banks said it decided to leave interest rates unchanged at today ' regular weekly meeting .

trust co , which also quotes its broker loan rate publicly , is posting a 7 - pct rate. volatility likely to remain low in debt futures chicago , march 18 financial analysts see little chance that u.s. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week . 
" we got a little volatility wednesday , " said staley commodities international analyst jerome lacey . 
" but for the moment we ' still in a trading range even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the u.s. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state , the analysts said . 
" it ( the bond market ) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility , " said carroll mcentee and mcginley analyst denis karnosky . 
" it needs something , but it ' not going to be news about the economy , " he said . 
karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the federal reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy . 
but even wednesday , when fed funds were below six pct , the dollar strong and oil on the soft side , bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs , he said . 
in addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy , golden gate futures president norman quinn said the beginning of april could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace . 
" the market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in japan on april 1 , " quinn said . 
quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested . 
if japanese investment in u.s. securities does materialize at the start of japan ' fiscal year , domestic funds may also flow into the bond market , he said . 
" we could get a stiff rally , possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7 - pct , " compared to the current yield of about 7 pct , quinn said . 
in the meantime , even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures . 
the treasury ' announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late wednesday after the close of futures . 
" i ' be surprised if supply pushed us out of it ( the trading range ) , " lacey said .

bill tender falls to 9 pct national australia bank lowers benchmark prime melbourne , april 6 national australia bank ltd naba said it lowered its benchmark prime lending rate to 18 pct from 18.5 , effective today , but left its base rate at 18.5 . 
the benchmark reduction brings the rate into line with the prime rates of most of australia ' trading banks , including those of two of the other three major trading banks . 
however , the rate is above the 18 pct the lowest ruling rate set by the other major , the australia and new zealand banking group ltd <anza.s> , on friday and effective today . 
the benchmark is based on short - interest rate movements while the base rate is tied to longer - trends. baker repeats he hopes prime hike temporary washington , april 3 treasury secretary james baker reiterated his hope that this week ' rise in prime rates would be a temporary blip upwards . 
" i would hope that it would simply be a temporary blip upward as we ' seen in the past , " baker said in television interview with the cable news network . 
the interview airs tomorrow but cnn released extracts from his remarks today . 
baker also repeated his position that the reaction of financial markets to u.s. tariffs on japanese electronic goods showed " the importance of the united states not going protectionist . 
the markets were telling us careful reuter union bank raises its prime rate to 7 pct los angeles , april 1 the union bank subsidiary of standard chartered plc said today it was raising its prime lending rate to 7 pct from 7 pct , effective immediately. spain deregulates bank deposit interest rates madrid , march 5 spain ' finance ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the european community (ec) , a ministry spokesman said . 
the measure was published today in the official state gazette . 
it takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates , now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days . 
the government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified " of public interest some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year . 
secretary of state for the economy guillermo de la dehesa told reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation. h.k. banks to raise prime rates soon , dealers say hong kong , april 1 banks in hong kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6 - pct following a one - point prime rate increase by two major u.s . 
banks yesterday , dealers said . 
they told reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend ' routine meeting of the hong kong association of banks. g.c . 
goh , chief dealer of the standard chartered bank , said prime rate increases by citibank and chase manhattan bank to 7 - pct from 7 - may prompt hong kong banks to follow suit . 
goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6 - pct , the level at beginning of 1987 . 
the banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on february 28 after cutting it 1 - points from 6 - on january 15 in response to upside pressure on the hong kong dollar , he said . 
the medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today , with three months ending at 5 - to 4 - pct against yesterday ' five to 4 - close . 
the overnight rate , however , fell to 3 - to three pct from 4 - to four because of increased liquidity for a local stock issue. u.s. urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan washington , march 11 the u.s. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy , a reagan administration official said . 
the official ' comments also suggest that debtors ' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks , in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms . 
in addition , he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a " megabank , " where third world debt would be pooled , and suggested the administration would support such a plan , even though it was not formally proposing it . 
at the same time , however , the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground . 
the philippine proposal , together with argentine suggestions that " exit bonds " be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy , would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan , the official said in an interview with reuters . 
" all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered , " said the official , who asked not to be named . 
in october 1985 , washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund ( imf ) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations . 
in return , america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation - economic growth . 
" the multilaterals have been performing well , the debtors have been performing well , " said the official . 
but he admitted that the largest third world debtor , brazil , was clearly an exception . 
the official , who played a key role in developing the u.s . 
debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker , also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis . 
" we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively , " the official said . 
among those ideas , the official said , were suggestions that commercial banks create a " megabank " which could swap third world debt paper for so - called " exit bonds " for banks like regional american or european institutions . 
such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled , and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2 billion dlrs . 
he emphasised that the " megabank " was not an administration plan but " something some people have suggested other u.s . 
officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt . 
this plan , actively under consideration , would differ slightly from the one the official described . 
but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states . 
" if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go , fine . 
i don ' think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution . 
meanwhile , the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5 / pct above libor . 
" the philippine proposal is very interesting , it ' quite unique and i don ' think it ' something that should be categorically rejected out of hand , " the official said . 
banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes . 
these tradeable , dollar - notes would have a six - life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity , the country would guarantee a payment of 7 / point over libor . 
until now , bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low . 
the talks , now in their second week , are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5 billion of already rescheduled debt . 
the country , which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year , owes an overall 27 billion dlrs of debt . 
but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation , a development until now unacceptable to the banks . 
" it ' no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before , " the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek . 
" some people argue that ( cutting the spread ) is debt forgiveness.. . 
what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money , " he added . 
he said the u.s . 
debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines'. mercantile bank n.a. mtrc raises prime rate st. louis , april 1 mercantile bancorp said its mercantile bank n.a. raised its prime rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct , effective immediately. japan long - prime seen cut to record low soon tokyo , march 23 japan ' long - banks will soon cut their prime rate , now at a record low 5 pct , by 0 or 0 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five - debentures , long - term bankers said . 
the long - prime rate is customarily set 0 percentage point above the coupon on five - bank debentures issued by the long - banks every month . 
the latest bank debentures , at 4 pct , have met strong end - demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates , dealers said . 
the current 5 pct prime rate has been in effect since february 28. french 13 - t - average rate falls to 7 pct from 7 pct official bankers welcome spanish reserve requirement hike madrid , march 5 bankers welcomed the bank of spain ' decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks , saying it reflected the socialist government ' determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity . 
the central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from march 13 , saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets . 
bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the bank , which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth . 
" i think it ' a good measure , " a senior foreign banker said . 
" it ' a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy " it shows that the political will is very strong . 
they know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run , " he added . 
the head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago , the bank of spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements , preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates . 
but bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad , strengthening the peseta and making spanish exports less competitive . 
the government says industry ' competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation . 
at 8 pct last year , the rate was way above that of spain ' major trading partners in the european community , which it joined a year ago . 
to help meet this year ' target of five pct , it is insisting pay rises stay at that level , setting the stage for clashes with trade unions , who say they have made enough sacrifices . 
demonstrations by workers , students and farmers , whose demands essentially involve more government spending , have become an almost daily occurrence . 
but prime minister felipe gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can . 
bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard . 
the bank of spain , which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13 pct , left it unchanged at today ' auction . 
the rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year , when it was below 12 pct . 
bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months . 
the measure will take effect tomorrow , following the publication of the decree in today ' official gazette . 
bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and , inevitably , push lending rates higher . 
a companion measure , reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas , also takes effect tomorrow . 
officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates . 
bundesbank allocates 6 billion marks in 28 - repurchase pact at 3 pct national westminster bank cuts base rate london , march 9 national westminster bank plc said it has cut its base lending rate 0 percentage points to 10 pct today . 
national westminster said that it was responding to general easing in money market rates . 
its move followed a signal from the bank of england earlier this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the base rate , a surprise move following its strong signals last week that such a move would be premature . 
however , since then the pound has continued to gain strongly. fhlbb changes short - discount note rates washington , april 3 the federal home loan bank board adjusted the rates on its short - discount notes as follows maturity new rate old rate maturity 30 - days 5 pct 5 pct 30 - days 274 - days 5 pct 5 pct 274 - days 295 - days 5 pct 5 pct 295 - days 345 - days 5 pct 5 pct 345 - days barclays , midland follow natwest base rate cut london , march 9 barclays bank plc bcs and midland bank plc mdbl said they are cutting their base lending rates to 10 pct from 11 pct . 
the cuts follow a similar move by national westminster bank plc nwbl the rate changes take effect tomorrow . 
the base rate reductions came after the bank of england cut its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank base lending rates , market sources said . 
until the end of last week , the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the time of the government ' annual budget on march 17 . 
sterling remained firm around 1 dlrs compared with its close here on friday at 1 dlrs. brazil ' gros to meet banks on trade line issue new york , march 11 brazil ' central bank governor francisco gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country ' unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt , bankers said . 
gros will meet representatives of citibank , the head of brazil ' bank advisory committee , and of co - morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc . 
high on the agenda will be banks ' complaints about brazil ' accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short - trade and interbank lines , the bankers said . 
brazil ' several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last march to extend the credit lines until march 31 , 1987 , as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package . 
bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment , coupled with brazil ' freeze , raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with gros . 
they said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank . 
this means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another . 
the requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest - spreads , because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank . 
" it ' caused a lot of ill - with the banking community , " one banker said . 
gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10 - tour of europe and japan that he and finance minister dilson funaro have just completed to seek official support for brazil ' debt stance. first chicago fnb raises prime rate chicago , april 2 first chicago corp said its first national bank of chicago raised its prime rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct , effective immediately. fed expected to add reserves , economists say new york , march 27 the federal reserve is expected to enter the u.s. government securities market to add reserves today , economists said . 
they said the fed would probably supply temporary reserves indirectly by arranging one to two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements . 
after averaging 6 pct yesterday , federal funds were opened at 6 - pct and remained at that level. bankers trust bt raises prime lending rate new york , april 1 bankers trust co said it has raised its prime lending rate to 7 - pct from 7-1/2 , effective immediately .

bill tender falls to 9 pct german government needs seen raising bond yields frankfurt , march 9 increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year , bond market sources say . 
" at the moment we have a sideways movement in the short - term rates . 
but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners , " one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in frankfurt said . 
the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs . 
friday ' loan stock was the third this year already , the sources noted . 
it carried a 10 - maturity , a coupon of six pct and price of 100 - to yield 5 pct at issue . 
this compared with the last issue which had a 5 - pct coupon priced at 99 - pct for a yield of 5 pct . 
but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors , and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon . 
sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size , with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last may . 
one finance ministry economist said " it isn ' more . 
it ' just the size ( of each bond ) which has increased he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt . 
until recently , federal issues sold very strongly abroad , with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors . 
with the recent stabilisation of the u.s . 
dollar , however , foreign investors have begun to back away from the market , as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish . 
sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing , having raised more than 18 billion marks . 
the government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986 . 
but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26 billion . 
the sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form . 
although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently , other factors , including the government ' tax reduction program , would also reduce income next year . 
" the problem here will be the tax reform , " the portfolio manager said . 
he added that the government ' cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings . 
the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other . 
the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year , it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6 billion marks through the issue of fixed - medium - " kassenobligation " notes . 
a finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22 billion marks this year . 
though many sources agreed , they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect . 
" i would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase , " the manager said . 
bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance , with the bundesbank ' public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5 pct on friday from 5 a week earlier . 
but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack , as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark . 
" the demand wasn ' so good , " a dealer for a german bank in london said . 
the dollar ' recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently , some dealers said. westpac in n.z. raises indicator lending rate wellington , april 2 westpac banking corp in new zealand said it will increase its indicator lending rate by 1 percentage points to 22 pct from april 7 . 
westpac said in a statement the increase reflects high costs of funding . 
the bank said nervousness in the wholesale deposit market is creating uncertainty about the immediate outlook for interest rates . 
liquidity is expected to remain tight over the next month and this will put upward pressure on interest rates .

" i would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates , " lawson said in a radio interview . 
analysts said they foresaw u.k .

repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years with 8 - years ' grace at 1 - percentage points over the london interbank offered rate , libor . 
the margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1 - point from 2-1/2 . 
the package should save jamaica about 3 mln dlrs a year . 
prime minister edward seaga , who led the jamaican delegation , called the terms very favourable to his country .

the bank is the first to lower its prime rate below the 18 pct set by a few banks in the last few days in a continuation of a downward trend which began late last month . 
other prime rates range from 18 to 18 pct , with the majority on 18.25 . 
the bank said the reduction reflected the recent downturn in money market rates , the improved economic outlook and adequate liquidity in the second quarter tax rundown period. lawson says he favours gradual approach to cuts in u.k. interest rates manufacturers national mntl raises prime detroit , april 1 manufacturers national bank of detroit said it increased its prime rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct , effective immediately. citicorp cci rules out credit card price war new york , march 24 american express co ' axp recent launch of a new " optima " credit card , with relatively low interest rates and fees , will increase competition with bank credit - issuers but will not lead to a pricing war , a senior citicorp offical said . 
" over the next two to three years , a very interesting marketing battle will be fought ... competition will not be on price but on product features , " pei - chia , head of the u.s. card products group , told a banking analysts meeting . 
citicorp is the leading u.s. bank credit - issuer , with some 10 mln accounts and an 11 pct market share . 
chia said that citicorp would focus its credit card marketing efforts on acceptance , noting that visa and mastercard currently enjoy a two - advantage over american express in terms of worldwide acceptance . 
he also doubted the popularity of american express ' plan to link interest charges on the new optima card to the bank prime lending rate . 
" the consumer likes to have a fixed rate instrument , " he said . 
richard braddock , head of the whole individual banking division , added that when there is increased competition , " it is not the big people who get crunched but the small ones austrian banks divided over interest rate cut vienna , april 1 calls for a cut in austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue . 
karl vak , general director of the zentralsparkasse und kommerzialbank , wien , called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board . 
but hannes androsch , head of creditanstalt - cabv told reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers . 
vak told a news conference that last january ' cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient . 
the january cut followed the national bank ' lowering of its discount and lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar bundesbank move . 
prime lending rate is now 8 pct and deposit rates vary between 3 and 5 pct . 
yesterday hellmuth klauhs , head of the genossenschaftliche zentralbank ag , said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point , or even half a point if german rates dropped further . 
vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct . 
a widening gap between austrian rates and cheaper west german credit along with forecasts of slow austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop , he said . 
karl pale , head of girozentrale und bank der oesterreichischen sparkassen ag girv has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment . 
interest margins were too small , particularly when compared with other west european countries .

the cuts follow a similar move by national westminster bank plc nwbl the rate changes take effect tomorrow . 
the base rate reductions came after the bank of england cut its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank base lending rates , market sources said . 
until the end of last week , the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the time of the government ' annual budget on march 17 . 
sterling remained firm around 1 dlrs compared with its close here on friday at 1 dlrs. u.s. bill auctions seen at 5.63-65 , 5 pct new york , march 9 the u.s . 
treasury ' weekly auction is expected to produce an average rate of 5 pct for three - bills and one of 5 pct for six - bills , dealers said .

the loan program offers borrowers home mortgage financing with no discount fees charged .

they said they expect thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market . 
many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates , they said . 
six major thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0 to 0 percentage point on february 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand , the sources said . 
excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986 . 
the current gross 7 pct interest rate for one - fixed bank deposit and the 11 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade . 
bankers said the thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively . 
profits of many thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth . 
the bank of thailand estimated overall lending by the thai banking system grew 3 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits . 
reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the thai stock market this week . 
the securities exchange of thailand ( set ) index on monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years , shooting up 4 points to a new seven - high of 223.02 . 
brokers and market analysts said thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market . 
thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the bank of thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital . 
if the regulation is not extended beyond its april 3 expiry date , many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct . 
bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market. bank of england resists pressure for rate cut london , march 5 the bank of england again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre - interest rate cut , leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade - index to a six - month high . 
it closed at its best level since september 12 , at 71 pct of its 1975 value on the index , as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short - capital gains , dealers said . 
meanwhile , opinion is divided over whether the bank can stop a cut before budget day , march 17 , and why it should want to . 
the bank ' latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon , when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11 - pct to relieve a money market shortage . 
" they ' really making the discount houses suffer , " said stephen lewis , economist at brokerage house phillips and drew . 
" eleven and three - pct is way above money market rates this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges , talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday , so buyers came strongly into the pound . 
the pound surged to a high of 1 dlrs at the london close , up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60 , and 2 marks , up from 2.8720/50 . 
" if this pressure keeps up is a possibility that rates could drop before the budget , " said jeremy hale , economist at finance house goldman sachs international corp . 
some gilt traders are forecasting a half - cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow . 
however , analysts said the bank of england will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re - rather than a result of short - speculative gains . 
there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious , said peter fellner , u.k . 
economist at brokers james capel and co . 
markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a conservative party victory in any early general election , and disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds , fellner said . 
an election could be delayed until mid-1988 , but most forecasts say it will be this year . 
others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar . 
however , analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether . 
the authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move , one way or the other , to half points here and there . 
some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long - capital coming into the london market , notably from japan . 
they argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar , given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in washington . 
the bank may want to see another few points on the trade - index before the budget , argued lewis . 
" but by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of england , " he added . 
the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget , but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders . 
meanwhile , analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front , today ' figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1 billion stg . 
this was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2 billion stg in 1985 . 
fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause , but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals . 
the guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets . 
privately , some bank officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this week , but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow . 
if a move comes before march 17 , forecasts are for a half - cut , with another half or full point about budget day. u.k. issues one billion stg bond tranche london , march 9 the bank of england said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8 - pct treasury loan stock due 1997 , payable 40 stg pct on application . 
the stock was issued to the bank at 96 stg pct and will be available for dealings from march 11 , with the remainder of the amount payable on may 5 . 
the bank said the bonds would yield 9 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas . 
the issue would be designated 8 - pct treasury loan 1997 " b a further 100 mln stg was reserved for the national debt commissioners . 
the market dropped by up to 1 / point following the bank ' announcement , with the treasury 13 - pct stock due 2004 / quoted one full point lower at 134 - stg pct around 20 minutes after the news . 
dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower u.k . 
interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling ' strength . 
the bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and u.k . 
clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10 pct from 11 pct . 
the bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because , dealers said , the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the u.k . 
budget on march 17 , thereby preserving the full impact of chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson ' package of measures . 
however , in the face of sterling ' apparently inexorable climb , the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half - cut . 
today ' one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling . 
most market participants believe that lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget , although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage . 
dealers noted that as part of the authorities ' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates , the bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the government bond market . 
to the surprise of most participants , the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains . 
dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's . 
however , they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut , it had still closed on a trade - basis at 72.4 , well ahead of friday ' final 71 and only just beneath the peak of 72 touched at 1300 gmt . 
bundesbank sets 28 - securities repurchase tender at fixed 3 pct new venezuela debt interest rate goes into effect caracas , april 1 the new interest rate of 7 / pct over libor on venezuelan public sector debt payments goes into effect today , finance minister manuel azpurua said  . 
azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the previous margin of 1 - pct above libor will save the country some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing . 
the new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20 billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling . 
under the new agreement , venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to 14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987 - period by 64 pct . 
azpurua said that according to the agreement , the new interest rate will be retroactive to april 1 , provided the accord is approved before october 1 . 
he told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13 - debt steering committee and is now being sent to the country ' 460 creditor banks for their approval . 
the new agreement replaces a rescheduling accord signed in february 1986 , which venezuela asked to revise to reflect a 45 pct drop in oil revenues. bank of new york bk raises prime to 7 - pct new york , april 1 bank of new york said it raised its prime lending rate a quarter point to 7 - pct .

treasury said its weekly auction of three - bills produced an average rate of 5 pct , with a 5 pct rate on six - month bills . 
these rates compared with averages of 5 pct for the three - and 5 pct for the six - bills sold last week . 
the bond - equivalent yield on three - bills was 5 pct . 
accepted bids ranges from 5 pct to 5 pct and 29 pct of the bids at the high , or stopout rate , were taken . 
for six months , the yield was 5 pct and the bids ranges from 5 pct to 5 pct with 30 pct of the bids accepted .

the bank last adjusted its short - treasury certificate rates on march 23 , when it also reduced rates for all three periods by 0 points . 
a national bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates . 
the spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the move would herald a reduction in discount rate , which currently stands at eight pct , when the bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is discussed next wednesday . 
the discount rate generally moves in tandem with the three - treasury certificate rate . 
however , there is no formal link and the discount rate was not adjusted following the march 23 changes. n.y. bank discount borrowings nil in week new york , march 26 the eight major new york city banks did not borrow from the federal reserve in the week ended wednesday march 25 , a fed spokesman said . 
it was the second half of a two - bank statement period that ended on wednesday . 
the banks did not borrow in the first week of the period. bank of england signals half point cut in short term rates dealers iif executive sees interest rates declining washington , april 1 institute of international finance managing director horst schulmann said that his orgnaization has been forecasting further declines of interest rates in the first half this year and then a levelling off and there is no reason to change that . 
speaking to reporters , the bank research group said that the increase in interest rates announced yesterday and other activity in the foreign exchange markets did not indicate a fundamental change in the outlook . 
schulmann , speaking broadly about the global debt problem , said that the international monetary fund should increase its assistance to third world countries . 
the remarks come just before next week ' meeting of the imf ' interim committee and the joint development committee of the imf and world bank . 
in a letter to the committee's , the bank group said , " commercial banks cannot be the dominant supplier of balance of payments finance schulmann said that imf exposure peaked in 1985 and has declined a bit since then. bankamerica bacp raises prime rate to 7 pct san francisco , april 2 bankamerica corp , following moves by other major banks , said it has raised its prime rate to 7 pct from 7 pct , effective today. gm ' gm pontiac has interest rate incentives pontiac , mich. , march 4 general motors corp said its pontiac division has established an interest rate support incentive program , effective immediately , as an alternative to its current option bonus program .

a customer may choose only one program , it said. u.s. sells 3 - bills at 5 pct , stop 5 pct , 6 - 5 pct , stop 5 pct bank of england pressure holds base rates london , march 6 this week ' bank of england resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct . 
but at a cost of threatening the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson ' policy , stated at the end of the paris group of six meeting last month , that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels , market sources said . 
since then , the pound has risen to 71 pct on its closing trade - index , up from 69 pct imediately after the paris meeting and up 0 on the day . 
today ' peak at 72 pct was its highest since august 19 . 
a treasury spokesman said lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling . 
the question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting . 
paul temperton , chief economist at merrill lynch europe ltd , estimated that the government wanted to see the trade - weighted index about 72 - pct . 
" even after this action over the last few weeks , sterling ' only just within striking distance of that range , " he said . 
other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area . 
however , they said lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term , despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports . 
" if the bank of england keeps the interest rates as they are , what ' to stop it ( going higher ) , " said john cox , executive director of ebc amro bank ltd , a major operator on the london foreign exchange market . 
cox estimates that the bank of england has been active selling sterling over the past few days , despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention , and this has helped keep it below 1 dlrs . 
the pound rose to 1 dlrs from 1 yesterday and 1 february 23 , the day after the paris meeting . 
but cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels . 
he warned the bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat . 
" if rates don ' come down , the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling , " he said . 
most dealers agree there is a good deal of " hot money " being invested in sterling , money simply attracted by high overnight or one - rates , which could flow out at equally short notice . 
however , the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long - investment . 
" the last thing they want to do is reduce them ( rates ) and have to jack them back up again , " said richard jeffrey , economist at brokerage house hoare govett ltd . 
he said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling , at least in the near term . 
however , most analysts are still looking for a full point about march 17 , budget day . 
the bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the budget , said temperton . 
the budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run - to a general election , the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets . 
" lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget . 
he wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut , " said ian harwood , economist at warburg securities , the equities arm of mercury international group . 
speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today . 
there was excitement a fall in the weekly treasury bill rate to 9 pct from 10 pct last friday might mean the bank had changed its mind . 
this followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3 / pct on the discount houses yesterday , and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct , early last october . 
however , with this bill rate pertaining to three - money , banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the bank ' intentions on short term rates. first national bank of boston bkb raises prime new york , april 1 the first national bank of boston , the main banking unit of bank of boston , said it is raising its prime lending rate to 7 pct from 7 pct , effective immediately. first bank systems fbs units hike rate minneapolis , april 1 first bank minneaplois and first bank saint paul , both units of first bank systems inc , said they raised their reference rates to 7 - pct from 7 - pct. comerica cmca raises prime rate detroit , april 2 comerica inc said it raised its prime interest rate to 7 - pct from 7 - pct , effective april 1. fed buys 500 mln dlrs of bills for customer new york , march 24 the federal reserve purchased about 500 mln dlrs of u.s . 
treasury bills for a customer , a spokeswoman said . 
she said that the fed bought bills maturing in june and july , and on august 27 and september 10 for regular delivery tomorrow . 
dealers said that federal funds were trading at 6 - pct when the fed announced the operation. west german banks slowly cutting key savings rates frankfurt , march 18 west german commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates , banking sources said . 
the cuts follow nearly two months after the bundesbank reduced leading interest rates , far longer than the usual interim period . 
a deutsche bank ag dbkg spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0 percentage points to two pct . 
dresdner bank ag drsd and commerzbank ag cbkg have initiated similar moves . 
bank fuer gemeinwirtschaft ag bkfg cut rates 0 pct generally . 
the delay was partly due to commercial banks ' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks . 
a fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks , forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources , one economist at the german banking association said . 
but the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future , he said . 
he said this may conflict with bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short - deposits to longer - securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate . 
the aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7 pct in february against the fourth quarter of last year , unchanged from january . 
the growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct . 
few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers , though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline. lloyds bank matches base rate cut to 10 pct london , march 9 lloyds bank plc lloy said it is cutting its base lending rate to 10 pct from 11 pct , effective tomorrow .

in a report to president corazon aquino on his department ' performance during the year ended february 28 , ongpin said at least 15 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year . 
he said the goal for official development assistance ( oda ) this year is two billion dlrs , adding that aid donors have committed oda inflows of 1 billion dlrs in 1987 , up 30 pct from 1 billion in 1986 . 
ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax ( vat ) system due to be introduced in 1988 . 
he gave no other details . 
he said treasury bill maturities , interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly . 
" in particular , short - prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985 , are now down to less than 10 pct , " he said . 
ongpin said the government ' debt - scheme , introduced in august last year , had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications , but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61 mln dlrs at end-february . 
he said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non - assets owned by associates of former president ferdinand marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform . 
aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan . 
ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a world bank - consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors . 
the government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9 mln hectares of land to poor peasants. bundesbank will not hold press conference tomorrow frankfurt , april 1 the bundesbank will not hold a press conference after its regular fortnightly council meeting tomorrow , a spokesman said in answer to enquiries .

mortgage rate by 1 pct to 11 pct german bond yields seen falling in near term frankfurt , march 23 west german bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates , as seen in last month ' paris pact , extend to keeping down european interest rates , banking economists said . 
but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany ' economy , they said . 
the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention , economists said . 
economists speculated that g - countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling u.s. and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april . 
" the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant . 
they mark an uncoupling of movements in u.s. and foreign interest rates , " salomon bros inc said in a recent study . 
it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar ' fall . 
these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized . 
west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u.s. not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point , to avoid weakening the dollar . 
west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline . 
" it ' not a taboo , " peter pietsch , spokesman for commerzbank ag said . 
but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year , as re - inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year . 
the bundesbank ' average yield of public paper is already nearing last year ' low . 
last week , yields fell to around 5 pct , not far from the 1986 low of 5 pct posted in mid-april . 
economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer - paper . 
such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long - rates , which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate . 
it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates , as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank ' central bank money stock aggregate . 
but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts , part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u.s. demands for faster west german growth . 
this move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing . 
this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak , but demand could emerge if rates begin rising . 
economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources , including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth , and higher than expected spending . 
josef koerner , chief economist of the west german ifo-institut , said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november . 
any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up . 
but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar ' decline , long term yields may to have to rise , economists said . 
public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn ' tax reform package . 
the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5 billion marks to 14 billion . 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable . 
finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform , such as raising indirect taxes . 
but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing . 
the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits . 
the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed a large 21 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14 billion in fourth quarter 1985 . 
the federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures , and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year , when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter. royal / canada ups u.s. base rate 1 / pct to 8 - pct treasury balances at fed rose on march 23 washington , march 24 treasury balances at the federal reserve rose on march 23 to 3 billion dlrs from 3 billion dlrs on the previous business day , the treasury said in its latest budget statement .

he told a news conference that rates in the u.s. , japan , west germany and switzerland were near their lows . 
" the weight of opinion is ( that in a year from now ) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates , " he said . 
the world bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates . 
the policy of the world bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when , where and how much to borrow , rotberg said . 
cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years ' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years . 
although the world bank had pioneered the swap market , it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation , rotberg said . 
of a total of 74 billion dlrs debt outstanding , only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency . 
many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers . 
until the world bank was confident that this was not the case , it would not adopt new instruments . 
the world bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before , rotberg said . 
however , for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants . 
the world bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in germany since the first issue was launched in 1959 , he said. .
