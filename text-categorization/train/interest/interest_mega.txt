BANK OF ENGLAND INVITES BORROWING AT 10 PCT
    LONDON, March 18 - 
The Bank of England said it had invited those discount houses wishing
to use borrowing facilities to do so at 1430 GMT today at a rate of 10
pct for 14 days. This compares with the Bank's present band one
dealing rate of 10-3/8 pct. The Bank of England's announcement was
quickly followed by Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank which
announced a half-point cut in their base rates to 10 pct from 10-1/2
pct. Dealers said the lowering in base rates had been widely expected
following yesterday's U.K. Budget in which Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson announced a three billion stg cut in the Government's
public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 to four billion stg. Many

BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS
    MADRID, March 26 - 
The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion pesetas in assistance funds
which bankers said reflected fears of fresh increases in overnight
rates. The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after
the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion pesetas. A
spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call
money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing
money supply figures for February. The M-4 money supply, measured as
liquid assets in public hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1
pct in January and compared with this year's eight pct target. Money
supply growth was 11.4 pct last year. The central bank on Tuesday
raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on
demand for 746 billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start
of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
demand for funds. "The policy is proving counter-productive and rates
will have to come down in the long-term," the bank spokesman said in
reply to Reuters enquiries. He said higher rates were fuelling an
influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad. "At least 800

BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.5 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER
    FRANKFURT, March 24 - 
The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5 billion marks at today's tender
for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a
central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion
marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow
and must buy back securities pledged on April 22. The allocation was
in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more
than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier
facility expires. Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the
allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said. The excess
allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the
Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks. However major
tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this
week, lessening the need for liquidity. The call money declines
surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank
disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had
not occurred. Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1
billion marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from
49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first 20

BANK BOARD SAYS MORTGAGE RATES DOWN IN FEBRUARY
    WASHINGTON, March 9 - 
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said interest rates on both fixed

BANK OF ENGLAND LENDS ONE BILLION STG AT 10 PCT
    LONDON, March 18 - 
The Bank of England said it had lent one billion stg to the discount

FHLBB SAYS MORTGAGE RATES CONTINUE DECLINE
    WASHINGTON, April 3 - 
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said home mortgage rates fell from
early February to early March to their lowest point in nine years, but
the rate of decline was slower than it had been in recent months. The
bank board said the average effective commitment rate for fixed-rate
mortgages for single family homes and a 25 pct loan-to-price ratio
with a maturity of at least 15 years was 9.48 pct in early March. The
rate was four basis points lower than a month ago, only one-eighth the
size of decline in the previous month, the bank board said. Rates for
adjustable-rate mortgages decline eight basis points from early
February to 8.43 pct in early March, the bank board said. The drop was
far less than the 15 basis point decline in the previous period, the
agency said. The average effective interest rate on all loans closed
by major mortgage lenders declined nine basis points from early
February to early March, the agency said. The fall brought the rate to
9.14 pct was the lowest since December 1977, it said. The effective
rate for ARMS was 8.39 pct, 15 basis points below a month earlier. For
fixed-rate loans it was 9.36 pct, 14 basis points below a month

PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS DELAYED FOR CONSULTATIONS

GERMAN BANKS SEE LOW INTEREST RATES CONTINUING
    BONN, March 19 - 
The Association of German Cooperative Banks said in a financial survey
that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time
being. It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the
economy that could affect the long-term capital market. The inflation
rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest
rates. But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very
slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year's end and next
year, it said. The association said generally low interest rates,
prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected strong
domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would
remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure
growth. The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates
down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted
little effect on the long-term capital market, which was so important
for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy, it
said. In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had
in influencing the longer-term capital market, the association saw
little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and
expansionist monetary policy. On the other hand it also saw no reason
for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of
1987. The association said time would show to what extent speculative
foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort
money supply developments. The Bundesbank could hold down money market
rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase
transactions, it said. Reuter 

SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY
    TOKYO, March 11 - 
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left

rates levels are now approaching their lower limit. "The government
should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"
he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a
comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to
adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major
industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a
comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn
would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita
also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of
the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the
foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and
this explains the recent stability in the currency markets.
Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening

NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES
    LONDON, March 11 - 
U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-
point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as
evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday.
The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department
unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and
paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments
between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a
reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line
with the rest of the market. The move was followed by a surprise sell-
out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap
issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They
said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which
the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear
evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than
later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997
occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on
money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month
interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with
another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year
highs against the dollar. "That government stock disappeared very
quickly indeed," said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at
stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market
believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for
more." Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was "of considerable significance." It
said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly
cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building
societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base
rates to 10 pct materialises." Building societies have said a drop in
bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give
rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and
Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may
reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a
mortgage rate cut. "National Savings has been competing too
effectively with the building societies of late. Building society
income has been depressed in recent months," he said. He and other
analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see
mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward
pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western
economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and
above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the
impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point
cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by
about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had
been complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts. "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing
some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National
Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said. A Savings
Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying
the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall
in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings
bonds way out of line with the rest of the market. "We are not
politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and
we don't need all that money," he told Reuters, adding the department
had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest
rates were above or below market rates. He said demand for the issue
had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their
steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial
three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the
first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to
government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01
billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures
show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for
11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER 

JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES
    TOKYO, Feb 27 - 
Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial
institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major
industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said. They said
the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which
should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct
minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau. The bureau channels
funds to government financial institutions for public works and other
official uses, they said. The base lending rate for state bodies such
as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with
long-term prime rates, the sources said. However, it was impossible
for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January
28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-
related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy,
they said. On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The
move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the
bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and
Welfare, the sources said. These ministries are trying to determine
which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's
deposit rate, the ministry sources said. Coupon rates on new 10-year
government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest
choice, they added. REUTER 

ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE
    LONDON, March 17 - 
British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one
full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion
stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four
billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The
analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget
as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already
started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and
money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief
economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one
full point tomorrow. "This is very much a safety-first budget in order
to get interest rates down," he said. Bootle said the money markets
had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key
three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last
night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-
point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but
this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. "This budget is
designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The
implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a
half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the
week," Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released
yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a
sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing
target. "There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.
National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower
borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an
early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be
analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to
achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-
point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget
small-print was convincing, "and I suspect it will be, it is entirely
possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this
week," Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut
would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending
rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base
rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained
pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts)
markets. But building societies said they would not cut lending rates
until base rates had fallen by one full point. REUTER 

INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE
    NEW DELHI, April 1 - 
The Indian Finance Ministry's announcement in Parliament yesterday,
changing the nation's interest rate structure, will benefit industry
and agriculture by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and
brokers said. The changes, effective today, included reducing
commercial bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5
pct by one percentage point. New rates, which affect both Indian and
foreign banks, also include a one percentage point gain, to an annual
10 pct, on deposits of two years or more but less than five. Bank
deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct interest have been
abolished. Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help improve
world competitiveness of Indian goods. There is likely to be a shift
to short-term bank deposits by long-term depositors, bankers
predicted. This will create the flexibility to draw and re-invest
funds in either equity shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due to lower
lending rates are likely to boost the share market. Tata Steel, a
trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange, opened today higher at
1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing of 1,012.50 rupees. A
stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now to buy
convertible and non-convertible debentures because the Finance
Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5 pct and 14 pct
respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively. "But overall debenture
prospects remain bright because the rates of interest on them will
still be higher than what banks pay for deposits of similar maturity,"
a merchant banker said. REUTER 

first three years, below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.
Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg
for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc <LLOY.L> will offer
300 mln stg. Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard
rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a half a
percentage point reduction in leading banks' base lending rates from
11 pct. Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely
still well above the new base rate level, although last year Lloyds
offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans. A Midland
spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of 2.7
billion stg, its existing mortgage book accounts for about 5 pct of
the total British home loan market. Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg
in outstanding mortgage loans, but had not estimated its total market
share. Among other major clearing banks, Barclays Plc <BCS.L> and
National Westminister Bank Plc <NWBL.L> said they had no immediate
plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes. Reuter 

CHASE MANHATTAN RAISES PRIME RATE TO 7-3/4 PCT FROM 7-1/2, EFFECTIVE TODAY




H.K. BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON, DEALERS SAY
    HONG KONG, April 1 - 
Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a
percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate
increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said. They told
Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend's
routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks. G.C. Goh, chief
dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said prime rate increases by
Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt
Hong Kong banks to follow suit. Goh said local banks want to restore
the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987. The banks
raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28
after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to
upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said. The medium and
longer term interbank rates firmed today, with three months ending at
5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close. The
overnight rate, however, fell to 3-1/2 to three pct from 4-1/2 to four
because of increased liquidity for a local stock issue. REUTER 

ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER U.S. PRIME RATE
    NEW YORK, March 31 - 
Quarter-point prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase
Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they
see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve's policy intentions,
economists said. "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but no
rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank's
surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by Chase, sent U.S. bond
prices lower and the dollar higher. McCulley said that once the spread
between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows
to less than 1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a
prime rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently. However,
banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed
intends to do about interest rates in the near term, analysts said.
They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements,
rather than lead them. For example, the last prime rate increase
occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2
pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year. Major
banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27,
when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed's
half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August
20. "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There should
be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and
others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. Jones
said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's meeting voted no
change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may well foster higher
interest rates soon. Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no
policy change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat up or
the economy shows sign of strong recovery. "The Fed clearly indicated
that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today's
coupon pass," said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that
came a day earlier than most expected, the Fed today supplied
permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all
maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account. This
seasonal reserve add is called a "pass." "The Fed demonstrated that
there has been no policy change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. She said the spread between banks' cost of
funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with
a 153 basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
increase. The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
"may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to
enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line." Reiners said that, given
recent problems with loans to developing countries, large money center
banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher
prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one
another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime
rate and also how quickly they move. In raising their prime rates,
banks cited a higher cost of funds. In the three business days through
Monday, the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up
funds. The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close
of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct.
Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds rate
probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct
area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there, banks may not
quickly boost their prime rates. But a consistently higher funds rates
would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher
interest rates to help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates
quickly. Reuter 

SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY
    TOKYO, March 11 - 
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left
for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest
rates levels are now approaching their lower limit. "The government
should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy,"
he told a press conference. His remarks were concerned with a
comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to
adopt in the coming days. At the recent talks among the six major
industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a
comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn
would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus. Sumita
also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of
the year if the yen remains stable. He said there is caution in the
foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and
this explains the recent stability in the currency markets.
Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening
market activity, he added. REUTER 

JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION
    TOKYO, March 2 - 
The Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further
interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate
ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official
said. The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said.
Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln. The interest
rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years
will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate
of deposit rate, the bank said. But the ceiling on MMCs with
maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75
percentage point below the CD rates. The minimum denomination of MMCs
will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln. The bank also said time
deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in
line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February
23. New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for
example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively. Demand
deposit rates, however, will remain the same. REUTER 

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE
    NEW YORK, April 1 - 
The prospect that other banks will follow industry leaders Citibank
and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a
pall over the credit markets today, economists said. Bond prices had
been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when
Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase
in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar - the
market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the news.
Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the Euromarket,
as the reason for raising its prime rate. Part of this rise in market
rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to
defend the dollar, but economists said it is too early to tell whether
the Fed, whose policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC,
meets this week, is already tightening its grip on credit. "The Fed
seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system's reserve
needs this statement period, but I wouldn't conclude anything until

TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES
    CHICAGO, March 13 - 
U.S. economic data due out next week is unlikely to hold any surprises
that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively
narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts
said. "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the current
strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything,"
said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains. The narrow range
trading is also taking its toll on trading volume, he noted. "We've
had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not
greatly changed people's viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said.
The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy,
coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after
the Paris initiative has made for "less than ebullient market action,"
Mains said. He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of
the trading range. "My view is that the economy remains relatively
strong and market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified," Mains said. Refco Inc senior vice president Michael
Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and
lacks retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening,"
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said. Although
data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices, the small
rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January
retail sales and industrial production were "not real exciting," said
Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. "There is no one factor that
will push us through the highs at this moment," Leiner said. Next
week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also
likely to be of little interest to the market, said Kleinwort Benson
chief financial economist Sam Kahan. Still, forecasts for first
quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the
next month. Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in
the January inventory data Friday, which showed the largest increase
since 1979. "The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is sustainable
or a one shot deal," Kahan said. He said that a sizable increase in
first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a
drag on second quarter growth. If that is the case, GNP in the second
quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

VOLATILITY LIKELY TO REMAIN LOW IN DEBT FUTURES
    CHICAGO, March 18 - 
Financial analysts see little chance that U.S. interest rate futures
will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the
remainder of the week. "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said
Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
moment we're still in a trading range." Even unexpected developments
concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur
the market out of its sluggish state, the analysts said. "It (the bond
market) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low
volatility," said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky.
"It needs something, but it's not going to be news about the economy,"
he said. Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of
the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized
and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy. But
even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the dollar strong
and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted eager sellers when
contracts approached recent highs, he said. In addition to a changing
perception about the dollar and monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures
president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign
investors back into the marketplace. "The market is beginning to feel
there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on
April 1," Quinn said. Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that
there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan's
fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond market, he
said. "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring yields on
long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to the current yield
of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said. In the meantime, even the prospect of
new supply is not likely to move futures. The Treasury's announcement
of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash
government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of
futures. "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the trading
range)," Lacey said. Reuter 

U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN
    WASHINGTON, March 11 - 
The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider
accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and
believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt
strategy, a Reagan administration official said. The official's
comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate
concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial
banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine
economic reforms. In addition, he signaled that the banks might want
to reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would
be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan,
even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time,
however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would
ever get off the ground. The Philippine proposal, together with
Argentine suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the
troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to
underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the
official said in an interview with Reuters. "All of these things would
fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we
think any novel and unique approach such as those should be
considered," said the official, who asked not to be named. In October
1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which
commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up
lending to major debtors nations. In return, America called on the
debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free
economic growth. "The multilaterals have been performing well, the
debtors have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted
that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception.
The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt
strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said
these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in
resolving the Third World debt crisis. "We called at the very
beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes
whereby they could operate more effectively," the official said. Among
those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks
create a "megabank" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-
called "exit bonds" for banks like regional American or European
institutions. Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need
to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package
was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current
negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. He emphasised that
the "megabank" was not an administration plan but "something some
people have suggested." Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial
banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third
World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ
slightly from the one the official described. But the official
expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United
States. "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go,
fine. I don't think they ever will." He pointed out that banks would
swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might
then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new
institution. Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under
which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more
than 5/8 pct above Libor. "The Philippine proposal is very
interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that
should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.
Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an
alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one
pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes. These tradeable,
dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks
swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a
payment of 7/8 point over Libor. Until now, bankers have criticised
these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are
aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and
granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The
country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington
since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall
27.8 billion dlrs of debt. But the official denied the plan amounts to
interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to
the banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have
a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before," the

concessions they seek. "Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is
debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new

JAPAN LONG-TERM PRIME SEEN CUT TO RECORD LOW SOON
    TOKYO, March 23 - 
Japan's long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate, now at a
record low 5.5 pct, by 0.2 or 0.3 percentage point in response to
falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures, long-
term bankers said. The long-term prime rate is customarily set 0.9
percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued
by the long-term banks every month. The latest bank debentures, at 4.6
pct, have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further
declines in yen interest rates, dealers said. The current 5.5 pct
prime rate has been in effect since February 28. REUTER 

BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE
    MADRID, March 5 - 
Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve
requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the
socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight
against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of
austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity
threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move
represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied
on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. "I think
it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said. "It's a faster way
to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant
effects on other areas of the economy." "It shows that the political
will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make
industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long
run," he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a
month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in
reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising
interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer
now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less
competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way
above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European
Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target
of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the
stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an
almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists
that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve
requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending
rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain,
which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5
pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased
nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case
with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for
time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect
tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official
gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of
funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure,
reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific
areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was
approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for
higher interest rates. REUTER 

BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE
    NEW YORK, March 11 - 
Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior
commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger
generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments
on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said. Gros
will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank
advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and
Lloyds Bank Plc. High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about
Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term
trade and interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred
creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines
until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with
Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that
the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems
because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a
Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with
the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
their credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to
deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been
able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks
would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited
with the central bank. "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking
community," one banker said. Gros is also expected to brief the banks
on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and
finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official
support for Brazil's debt stance. REUTER 

GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS
    FRANKFURT, March 9 - 
Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing
unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push
yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market
sources say. "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-
term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on
foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities investment
house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had
already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on
increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already,
the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct
and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with
the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a
yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to
attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size,
with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last
May. One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's just the
size (of each bond) which has increased." He added conditions in the
capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new
debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with
up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the
recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors
have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency
gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have
already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion
marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986.
But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was
26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the
more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly
inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors,
including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top
income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult
for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the
government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion
marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts
and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the
other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice
to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate
medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes. A finance ministry economist
said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its
plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many
sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue
next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. "I would expect
the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing
will increase," the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly
firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield
calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan
stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise
against the mark. "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German
bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against
the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said. REUTER 

JAMAICA AGREES DRAFT BANK DEBT RESCHEDULING

Jamaica agreed in principle with its bank advisory committee on a

AUSTRIAN BANKS DIVIDED OVER INTEREST RATE CUT
    VIENNA, April 1 - 
Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days
but bank chiefs are divided over the issue. Karl Vak, General Director
of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a
cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the
board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>
told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak
told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for
commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had
been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank's
lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line
with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and
deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth
Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates
could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if
German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen
below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West
German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth
this year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale,
head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG
[GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending
rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too
small, particularly when compared with other West European countries.
But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank
told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came
down first. Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates
alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming
opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER 

THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT
    BANGKOK, March 18 - 
Officials of five Thai commercial banks are expected to meet tomorrow
to seek agreement on cutting interest rates, banking sources said.
They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic
loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money
market. Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point
cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates, they said.
Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by
0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not
substantially increased loan demand, the sources said. Excess
liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite
five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current gross 7.25 pct interest
rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan
rate are the lowest in a decade. Bankers said the Thai banking system
is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which
have created problems for many banks in managing their money
effectively. Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth. The Bank
of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew
3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits. Reports
of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the
Thai stock market this week. The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET)
Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years,
shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02. Brokers
and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long
as liquidity remains in the money market. Thai and foreign bankers
said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not
extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions
up to 40 pct of bank capital. If the regulation is not extended beyond
its April 3 expiry date, many commercial banks will have to reduce
foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct. Bankers said such that
could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local
money market. REUTER 

BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT
    LONDON, March 5 - 
The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market
pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take
the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-
month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4
pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to
buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the
possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile,
opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget
Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong
signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment
came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal
rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. "They're really
making the discount houses suffer," said Stephen Lewis, economist at
brokerage house Phillips and Drew. "Eleven and three-quarters pct is
way above money market rates." This money market signal was apparently
not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk
of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers
came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808
dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60,
and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. "If this pressure keeps
up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget,"
said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs
International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut
in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced
that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result
of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank
to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James
Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances
of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold
back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds,
Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could
yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for
the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The
authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one
way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank
will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest
bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London
market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being
perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent
sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank
may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before
the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by then sterling should be firm enough
to satisfy even the Bank of England," he added. The Bank declined to
comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before
the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent
rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange
traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the
current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above
previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a
surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more
normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets
a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such
fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the
clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but
at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes
before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half
or full point about Budget day. REUTER 

U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE
    LONDON, March 9 - 
The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one
billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable
40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50
stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds
would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to
residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury
Loan 1997 "B." A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National
Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following
the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due
2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed
against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's
strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts
in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had
initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers
said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the
time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full
impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of
measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a
half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the
market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market
participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point
interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two
said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this
stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last
week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one
billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond
market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out
within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed
on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it
seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by
the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that
although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base
rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well
ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5
touched at 1300 GMT. REUTER 

NEW VENEZUELA DEBT INTEREST RATE GOES INTO EFFECT
    CARACAS, April 1 - 
The new interest rate of 7/8 pct over Libor on Venezuelan public
sector debt payments goes into effect today, Finance Minister Manuel
Azpurua said . Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the
previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country some 50
mln dollars in debt servicing. The new rate is among changes agreed
last month to the 20.3 billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling.
Under the new agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term
from 12 to 14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period
by 64 pct. Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new
interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the accord is
approved before October 1. He told reporters the term sheet detailing
the changes in the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the
13-member debt steering committee and is now being sent to the
country's 460 creditor banks for their approval. The new agreement
replaces a rescheduling accord signed in February 1986, which
Venezuela asked to revise to reflect a 45 pct drop in oil revenues.

U.S. BILL AUCTION RATES AVERAGE 5.63, 5.59 PCT
    WASHINGTON, March 9 - 
The U.S. Treasury said its weekly auction of three-month bills
produced an average rate of 5.63 pct, with a 5.59 pct rate on six-
month bills. These rates compared with averages of 5.47 pct for the
three- and 5.51 pct for the six-month bills sold last week. The bond-
equivalent yield on three-month bills was 5.81 pct. Accepted bids
ranges from 5.61 pct to 5.64 pct and 29 pct of the bids at the high,
or stopout rate, were taken. For six months, the yield was 5.85 pct
and the bids ranges from 5.56 pct to 5.60 pct with 30 pct of the bids
accepted. The Treasury said it received 30.9 billion dlrs of bids for
the three-month bills, including 1.0 billion dlrs in non-competitive
bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion dlrs of bids, including
2.2 billion dlrs from the Federal Reserve and 9.1 mln dlrs from
foreign and international monetary authorities. Some 25.7 billion dlrs
in bids for six-month bills were received, including 785 mln dlrs in

BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES
    BRUSSELS, April 3 - 
The Belgian National Bank cut interest rates on one, two and three-

reduction in discount rate, which currently stands at eight pct, when
the Bank holds its regular weekly meeting at which the rate is

BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES
    LONDON, March 6 - 
This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for
lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting
last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then
prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has
risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7
pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's
peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman
said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in
sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to
see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch
Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-
weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action over the last
few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that
range," he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has
some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson
would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short
term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper
prices on imports. "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as
they are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign
exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been
active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it
below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday
and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says
the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks
and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned
the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. "If rates
don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and
will sell sterling," he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal
of "hot money" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by
high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally
short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. "The last
thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them
back up again," said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house
Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued
support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most
analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget
Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget,
said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in
the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. "Lawson wants
to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be
crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut," said Ian Harwood,
economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury
International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and
lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall
in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday
might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition
of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday,
and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last
October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a
guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER 

WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES
    FRANKFURT, March 18 - 
West German commercial banks are cautiously cutting key savings and
lending rates, banking sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months
after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than
the usual interim period. A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said
it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional
basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>
and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank fuer
Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally. The delay
was partly due to commercial banks' desire to gauge customer reaction
to a similar move by regional savings banks. A fall in customer
savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing
available to banks, forcing them to draw down relatively expensive
funds from other sources, one economist at the German Banking
Association said. But the volume of savings funds may not be
substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers
are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said. He said this may
conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively
short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth
in its central bank money supply aggregate. The aggregate showed
annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the
fourth quarter of last year, unchanged from January. The growth rate
was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct. Few banks
have so far reduced lending rates to private customers, though lending
rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline. REUTER 

PHILIPPINES SEES 1987 GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP 26 PCT
    MANILA, March 16 - 
Philippine government revenue is expected to rise 26 pct to 99.9
billion pesos this year from 79.1 billion in 1986, Finance Secretary
Jaime Ongpin said. In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his
department's performance during the year ended February 28, Ongpin
said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax
reform measures announced last year. He said the goal for official
development assistance (ODA) this year is two billion dlrs, adding
that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in
1987, up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986. Ongpin said steps planned to
provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax (VAT) system
due to be introduced in 1988. He gave no other details. He said
treasury bill maturities, interest rate levels and the volume of
government securities sold to the private sector have improved
significantly. "In particular, short-term prime interest rates which
had gone over 40 pct in 1985, are now down to less than 10 pct," he
said. Ongpin said the government's debt-equity scheme, introduced in
August last year, had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of
applications, but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of
only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February. He said his department aims to
accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing
assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to
achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help
finance land reform. Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24
billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the
failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan. Ongpin
also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs
in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led
consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors. The
government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln
hectares of land to poor peasants. REUTER 

GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM 
    FRANKFURT, March 23 - 
West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if
recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month's
Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking
economists said. But in the longer term domestic yields could rise
under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said. The
Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the
threat of central bank intervention, economists said. Economists
speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by
uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet
for the IMF Interim Committee in April. "The recent round of monetary
accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming
of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of
movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates," Salomon Bros Inc said
in a recent study. It said narrowing of international interest rate
spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will
have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized. West German
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut
interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by
half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar. West German economists
see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar
resumes its decline. "It's not a taboo," Peter Pietsch, spokesman for
Commerzbank AG said. But most economists see room for a cut in West
German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging
inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year. The
Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last
year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from
the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April. Economists said the
trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to
longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve
between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced
since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate. It might also
facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings
accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central
bank money stock aggregate. But conflicting with this trend are plans
to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact
designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move
may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be
filled by higher government borrowing. This may not occur if private
sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if
rates begin rising. Economists said it appeared the government had
already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from
other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than
expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending. Josef
Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a
newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion
marks below estimates by the West German government in November. Any
tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled
with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark
bonds on the dollar's decline, long term yields may to have to rise,
economists said. Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise
owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.
The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by
5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl
said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is
acceptable. Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he
was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising
indirect taxes. But few economists believe the government will be able
to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.
The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to
believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be
managed without increasing deficits. The Bundesbank said West German
public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit
markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth
quarter 1985. The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks
of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks
of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not
required such a credit in the 1985 quarter. Reuter 

WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR
    FRANKFURT, March 9 - 
The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half
of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end,
World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said. He told a
news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and
Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight of opinion is (that in a
year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct
higher than one pct lower interest rates," he said. The World Bank had
not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the
expectation of higher interest rates. The policy of the World Bank was
to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to
decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said. Cash in hand
was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net
requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its
debt maturing within five years. Although the World Bank had pioneered
the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments
just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said. Of a total of 74.5
billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been
swapped into another currency. Many recent innovations were either
unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was
confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new
instruments. The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed
over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
instruments such as bonds with warrants. The World Bank had publicly
offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in
1959, he said. 
