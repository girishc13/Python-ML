i
have

but
because
my
reasons
for
not
partaking
religion
are
different
than
hers
can't
say
that
do
exactly
her
reason
is
she
needs
solid

:
there
no

therefor

still
can't

done
something
that

before
you
read
my
review
,
gotta
know
that
i
love
woody
allen
.
this
is
a
very
important
note
because
allen's
films
are
generally
an
acquired
taste
and
definitely
not
for
everyone
folks
who
believe
him
to
be
complete
genius
while
others
see
as
dirty
ol'
schnook
keeps
making
the
same
movie
over
again
most
of
his
but
will
admit
having
been
quite
disappointed
by
recent
crop
during
90s
in
fact
why
he
felt
need
make
10
movies
those
years
beyond
me
!
if
look
at
quality
you'll
hear
what
i'm
saying
only
two
really
liked

were
bullets
