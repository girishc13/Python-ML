dealers
said

today

that

a

suggested
that

needed

both

one

while

turned

during

s
economic
downturn
the
recent

has
allowed
them
to
refocus
their
attention
on
their

he
said
paradoxically
it
is
the
pick
up
in
the
economy
that
is
partly
to
blame
for
the
stock
market
collapse
as
companies
have
shifted
funds
away
from

to
increase
inventories
and
step
up

spending
one
government
economist
said
in
deciding
what
response
to
make
to
the
steep
stock
price
drop
the
bank
of
japan
must
first
determine
whether
prices
will
continue

then
decide
if
they
pose
a
greater

the

by
remarks
by

james

that
the

had
been

they
said
the

must
have

he
was
referring
to
the

fall
since
the

in

over

not
the

stability
than
on
other
currencies
throughout
the

meeting
japan
pointed
to
the
dangers
that
would
arise
from
a
further
dollar
fall
because
it
would
reduce
the
flow
of
japanese
capital
to
the
u

hurting
the
u

they
said

japanese

japan
the

the

called

to

i
think
at

meeting
in

what
we
ought
to
be
trying

is
to
get

are
involved

down
say
one
pct
bentsen
told
nbc

bentsen
said
coordinated
rate
cuts
could
take
billions
off
the

service
of
the
latin
countries
and
help
ease
protectionist
pressures
in
the
industrial

bentsen
also
south

should
be
pressured
to
revalue
their

enormous

nigel

britain
s
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
said
some
countries
may
need
to
cut
interest
rates
with
the
aim
of
maintaining
exchange
rate
stability
speaking
to
journalists
one
day
after
the
group
of
seven
countries
reaffirmed
goals
set
in
paris
six
weeks
ago
he
said
central
banks
would
continue
to
intervene
as
and
when
necessary
he
said
the
g
countries
were
concerned
that
japan
do
more
to
stimulate
domestic
demand
and
welcomed
measures
outlined
by
japanese
finance
minister
kiichi
miyazawa
yesterday
lawson
said
he
was
still
worried
about
the
risk
of
a
simultaneous
recession
in
the
united
states
japan
and
west
germany
though
less
so
than
when
he
gave
his
march
budget
speech
to
the
british
parliament
if
anything
i
m
a
little
bit
less
concerned
but
there
is
still
a
risk
he
said
asked
if
the
united
states
should
consider
increasing
interest
rates
to
support
the
dollar
he
said
if
there
is
a
need
for
changes
in
relative
interest
rates
it
doesn
t
need
to
be
a
rise
in
interest
rates
in
the
united
states
lawson
said
there
was
some
concern
expressed
in
yesterday
s
meetings
at
the
slow
progress
the
united
states
had
made
in
reducing
its
budget
deficit
we
believe
there
will
be
some
worthwhile
progress
in
reducing
the
deficit
this
year
the
important
thing
is
that
it
continue
year
after
year
lawson
said
the
february
louvre
accord
called
for
efforts
to
stabilize
currencies
at
then
current
exchange
rates
in
the
six
weeks
that
followed
the
japanese
yen
continued
to
rise
against
the
dollar
despite
massive
central
bank
intervention
asked
whether
this
intervention
was
a
sign
of
weakness
in
the
louvre
accord
he
said
i
don
t
think
so
if
there
had
been
no
intervention
you
would
have
called
that
a
sign
of
weakness
although
intervention
could
be
a
cause
of
inflation
lawson
said
the
world
does
not
appear
to
be
in
an
inflationary
mode
but
one
has
to
be
vigilant
he
said
yesterday
s
g
statement
which
affirmed
that
current
levels
of
exchange
rates
were
appropriate
had
been
carefully
worded
we
know
what
we
mean
and
we
all
mean
the
same
thing
he
said
lawson
said
financial
markets
seem
to
believe
that
japanese
measures
outlined
in
the
louvre
accord
were
the
source
of
weakness
for
that
agreement
therefore
the
g
countries
welcomed
miyazawa
s
presentation
of
plans
for
a
supplemental
budget
to
stimulate
domestic
demand
they
particularly
welcomed
the
goal
of
an
immediate
increase
in
public
works
spending
but
lawson
said
the
package
also
involved
a
second
stage
to
increase
expenditures
during

wojnilower

he

last

wojnilower

the

ecgd
senior

sources
said
the

is
being
developed
in

with
the
ecgd
and
the

of

neither
the
ecgd
nor
the
bank
of
england
would
comment
on
the
plan
however
bankers
said
one
of
the
main
points
under
discussion
is
a
plan
to
refinance
the
bulk
of
the
ecgd
s
medium
term
credit
portfolio
in
the
international
capital
markets
the
proposals
involve
introducing
a
set
of
interest
margins
on
ecgd
backed
debt
of
to
pct
depending
on
the
size
and
maturity
of
the
credit
and
the
currency
the
banks
are
likely
to
push
for
a
higher
margin
bankers
said
that
while
these
rates
would
reduce
a
bank
s
return
they
would
still
be
more
than
those
proposed
about
a
year
ago
when
the
government
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
initiate
another
cost
reduction
plan
at
the
same
time
the
banks
would
be
expected
to
allow
the
ecgd
to
realise
additional
savings
by
refinancing
existing
government
backed
credit
in
the
capital
markets
on
credits
that
are
refinanced

dashing
some

weak
u

economic
growth
could
hurt
the

much

poehl

he

since

that

itself

reason
we
in

everything

economists

an

more
than
a

blip
as
the

came
out
noting
that
such
a

under

almost
certainly
we

if

he

today
the

the

concerned
about

expectations

were
in

responsible
for
the
recent

prices
the

said
but
money
traders
said
the

generally
shrugged
off
the

cd
operation
because
it
was
small
and
at

below

in

was

while

was

they
said
the

s
bill
buying
operation
also
had
little
impact
because
it
was
regarded
as
a
routine
operation
they
said
the
money
traders
said
they
regarded
the
central
bank
s
cd
buying
operation
as
simply
a
gesture
to
live
up
to
japan
s
pledge
to
guide
interest
rates
lower
and
stimulate
the
economy
we
did
not
expect
the

to
ease
its

grip
any
further
a

manager

expectation
of

the

the

above

poehl
said
that
the
recent
rise
in

was
not
due
to
central

policy
but
to
markets
expectations
and
currency
developments
commenting
on
the
inflationary
expectations
poehl
said
you
have
to
get
to
the
root
of
the
problem
you
have
to
pursue
a
policy
which
reveals
that
there
are
no
grounds
for
such
fears
the
inflationary
fears
were
unjustified
and
exaggerated
he
said
poehl
rebuffed
recent
u

criticism
of
west
germany
saying
the
bundesbank
had
made
a
substantial
contribution
to
international
cooperation
in
interest
and
monetary
policy
the
bundesbank
has
tolerated
an
overshooting
of
its
money
supply
target
arousing
criticism
from
other
quarters
he
said
today
we
still
have
lower
interest
rates
than
at
the
end
of
quite
the
contrary
of
other
countries
where
interest
rates
have
risen
substantially
more
poehl
said
this
had
to
be
taken
into
account
when
considering
recent
rises
in
repurchase
pact
allocation
rates
which
were
due
to
rising
international
money
market
rates
that
had
spilled
over
into
the
german
market
he
said
poehl
expressed
surprise
that
financial
markets
had
so
far
ignored
improvements
in
the

the
adjustment
process
in
the

underway
he
said
noting
that
this

the

said
a

explaining
why
his

for
the

being
is
only
offering
variable

the
rash

to
solicit
new
business
has
helped
homebuyers
to
become
even
choosier
about
loans
and
lenders
concede
they
are
being
forced
to
undercut
each
other
still
more
sharp
cuts

reflect

competition

officials
at

institutions
said
the
fixed
rate
mortgages
on
offer
carry
interest
rates
even
below
those
on
the
variable
rate
loans
of
course
they
are
less
profitable
than
other
variable

mortgages
said
a
spokesman
for
midland
bank
plc
which
earlier
this
year
said
it
earmarked
mln
dlrs
for
fixed
rate
new
mortgage
loans
but
he
said
the
bank
is
willing
to
offer
less
profitable
loans
because
it
was
just
another
way
to
attract
people
to
our

at

earlier
this

the

that
tsb
set
aside
for
the

was
exhausted
within
just
a
few
days
according
to
a

everybody

an

she
said
noting
that
within
five
days
the

loaned
the
equivalent
of

of
its
volume
in
short
the
appeal
of
fixed
rate
mortgages
is
that
they
offer
an
opportunity
to
gamble
on
the
direction
of
interest
rates
if
interest
rates
fall
after
the
mortgage
is
made
the
lender
is
earning
an
above
average
return
on
assets
but
if
interest
rates
rise
it
is
the
homebuyer

won

benefit
of
cheap
money
household
mortgage
co
had
planned
to
offer
a
year
fixed
rate
mortgage
after
the
june
elections
on
the
assumption
that
a
conservative
party
victory
would
help
money
market
rates
fall
further
according
to
duncan
young
managing
director
young
explained
that
the
company
had
planned
to
protect
itself
against
the
chance
of
rising
interest
rates
by
buying
a
complicated
hedging
instrument
but
money
market
rates
have
risen
contrary
to
expectations
and
the
company
has
shelved
its
plans
for
the
time
being
he
said
money
market
rates
were
too
high
to
arrange
both
the
mortgages
and
hedge
profitably
however
he
said
that
when
the
household
mortgage
co
does
make
fixed
rate
mortgages
it
is
likely
to
securitise
them
this
means
bundling
different
mortgages
together
to
resemble
a
bond
and
selling
them
to
an
investor
for
technical
reasons
securitisation
is
simpler
and
more
efficient
with
fixed
rate
rather
than
with
floating
rate
mortgages
in
the
u
s
where
fixed
rate
mortgages
are
popular

he

we
