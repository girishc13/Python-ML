the

was
despite
a
last
minute
revolt
by
an
alliance
of
liberal

conservative

who
sought
to
defeat
it

we

stand
firm

win
the

disclosed
last

washington
june
the

that

to
provide
congress
with
a

on

policy
but
does
not
place
any
restrictions
on

the

passed
winning
a

voting
despite
a
last

revolt
by
an
alliance
of
liberal
democrats
and
conservative

who
sought
to
defeat
it
as
a
signal
that
a
growing
number
of
legislators
oppose
president
reagan
s
policies
in
the

the
legislation
was
passed
in
the
wake
of
the
may
iraqi
missile
attack
on
the
u

in
the

killed

within

it
did
not
however
place
any

on

as
it
proceeds
to

the
kuwaiti

and
thus
has
no

the

was

this

the

this

the

the

zeebregts
said
he
expected
the
judgment
to
go

they
were
therefore
very
likely
to
restart
