U.S. SENATE PANEL VOTES TO LIMIT COUNTY LOAN RATE  CHANGES STARTING WITH 1988 CROPS




USDA SEEKS COMMENTS ON GRAIN DISCOUNT SCHEDULE
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
The U.S. Agriculture Department is seeking public comments on the
question of adjusting the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC)
discount and premium schedules to improve the quality of grain it
accepts as loan collateral or under price support programs. The
premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality factors such as
moisture content and kernel damage. The schedule stipulates the
premiums and discounts used for valuing grain the CCC accepts or
purchases during the year. The department said it is possible that
producers could be encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC
by adjusting the premiums and discounts. Comments are due by April 24
and a report to Congress is required by law by May 10. Reuter 

USDA ESTIMATES 1986 SOVIET GRAIN CROP  AT 210 MLN TONNES VS 210 IN MARCH, 192 YEAR-AGO




SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT
    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - 
Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production
targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain
crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said.
USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier
estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could
match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic
targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln
tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent
article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to
be "25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year." "This indicates
that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop,"
the analyst said. In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the
235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production
estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes,
a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed
harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While
in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor
Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than
last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party
commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields,
harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln
tonnes. Reuter 

CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS
    PEKING, April 8 - 
A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities showed vermin consume
between seven and 12 pct of China's grain stocks, the China Daily
said. It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of
China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up to 30
pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on inadequate
storage and bad preservation methods. It said the government had
launched a national programme to reduce waste, calling for improved
technology in storage and preservation, and greater production of
additives. The paper gave no further details. REUTER 

U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER
    WASHINGTON, June 29 - 
Prospects appear slim for a summer meeting between U.S. and Soviet
officials before the two countries enter the final year of their
bilateral grains agreement, Agriculture Department officials said. The
two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement
approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February.
However, any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the
grains agreement that extends through September, 1988, USDA officials
said. "It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
meeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz
said. Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the next
talks could still be a "couple more months," he said. There has been
grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another
wheat subsidy during the next marketing year. But USDA officials said
even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably
not be made. "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this
summer or before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.
Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's
crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. It would be
uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now." Under the nonbinding
pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of
U.S. grain per year. Soviet and U.S. officials normally meet in the
summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain
quality, shipping logistics and production outlooks. Reuter 

BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE
    WASHINGTON, April 13 - 
Current prospects for this year's grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania
appear less favorable than in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's
officer in Belgrade said in a field report. The report said the
assessment was based on travel in the two countries from March 30 to
April 4. It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the prolonged
winter temperatures this spring. However, in general plant development
was at least three weeks or more behind normal this spring, and
conditions varied greatly by regions, the report said. Fields seeded
during the optimum period last fall, and especially those receiving
supplemental irrigation water (about 65 pct of the fields observed),
appeared to be in good condition, with little evidence of winterkill,
while others varied considerably, the report said. Fields lacking
adequate moisture last fall showed weak and uneven stands. Spotty
germination and winterkill in those fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it
said. Reuter 
