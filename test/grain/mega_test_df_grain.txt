the

public
comments
on
the
question
of
adjusting
the
commodity
credit

discount
and

schedules
to
improve
the
quality
of
grain
it

the

the

the

said
it
is
possible
that

could

to
delivery
higher
quality
grain
to

by
adjusting

washington
oct
recent
announcements
from
moscow
of
next
year
s
grain
production
targets
indicate
that
the
soviets
are
estimating
this
year
s
grain
crop
at
to
mln
tonnes
agriculture
department
analysts
said
usda
is
projecting
the
soviet
crop
at
mln
tonnes
but
some
earlier
estimates
from
soviet
officials
were
that
the
grain
crop
could
match
the
record
of
mln
tonnes
moscow
outlined
its
economic
targets
for
on
monday
putting
the
grain
harvest
goal
at
mln
tonnes
an
analyst
of
soviet
agriculture
at
usda
noted
that
a
recent
article
in
izvestia
said
soviet
grain
production
in
is
planned
to
be
to
mln
tonnes
more
than
expected
this
year
this
indicates
that
their
own
estimate
is
for
a
to
mln
tonne
grain
crop
the
analyst
said
in
calculating
moscow
s
crop
estimate
usda
used
the
mln
tonne
production
goal
as
well
as
a
mln
tonne
figure
published
in
a
soviet
economic
journal
this
month
usda
s
production
estimate
of
mln
tonnes
reflects
a
range
of
to
mln
tonnes
a
usda
source
said
late
season
rains
damaged
soviet
crops
slowed
harvest
progress
and
lowered
soviet
production
analysts
said
while
in
the
u
s
earlier
this
month
soviet
agriculture
official
viktor
nikonov
predicted
that
the
grain
crop
would
be
as
good
or
better
than
last
year
s
mln
tonne
harvest
a
member
of
nikonov
s
party
commented
that
although
mln
tonnes
of
grain
were
in
the
fields
harvest
problems
would
bring
the
final
crop
down
to
around
mln
tonnes
china

peking
april
a
survey
of
provinces
and
seven
cities
showed
vermin
consume
between
seven
and
pct
of
china
s
grain
stocks
the
china
daily
said
it
also
said
that
each
year
mln
tonnes
or
pct
of
china
s
fruit
output
are
left
to
rot
and
mln

or
up
to

the
paper
blamed
the
waste
on
inadequate
storage
and
bad
preservation
methods
it
said
the
government
had
launched
a
national
programme
to
reduce
waste
calling
for
improved
technology
in
storage

and
greater
production

u
s
soviet
grain
meeting
unlikely
this
summer
washington
june
prospects
appear
slim
for
a
summer
meeting
between
u
s
and
soviet
officials
before
the
two
countries
enter
the
final
year
of
their
bilateral
grains
agreement
agriculture
department
officials
said
the
two
sides
usually
try
to
meet
as
each
new
year
of
the
agreeement
approaches
although
the
last
meeting
was
delayed
up
to
last
february
however
any
delay
this
year
should
not
endanger
the
fifth
year
of
the
grains
agreement
that
extends
through
september
usda
officials
said
it
will
be
difficult
to
pull
together
the
people
for
the
meeting
during
july
an
aide
to
usda
undersecretary
daniel
amstutz
said
since
the
last
meeting
was
only
around
four
months
ago
the
next
talks
could
still
be
a
couple
more
months
he
said
there
has
been
grain
industry
speculation
that
the
usda
will
offer
moscow
another
wheat
subsidy
during
the
next
marketing
year
but
usda
officials
said
even
if
consultations
were
held
soon
a
subsidy
offer
would
probably
not
be
made
i
doubt
that
there
would
be
any
subsidy
offer
this
summer
or
before
the
next
agreement
year
begins
a
usda
source
said
citing
limited
subsidy
funds
and
uncertainties
about
next
year
s
crops
he
said
there
are
too
many
variables
now
it
would
be
uncharacteristic
of
us
to
make
an
offer
now
under
the
nonbinding
pact
moscow
has
agreed
to
purchase
a
minimum
of
nine
mln

soviet
