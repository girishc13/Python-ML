jardine
matheson
replaces
b
share
by
bonus
issue
hong
kong
april
jardine
matheson
holdings
ltd
jard
hk
said
it
will
withdraw
the
previously
announced
four
for
one
bonus
issue
of
b
shares
and
replace
it
by
a
two
for
five
bonus
issue
of
ordinary
shares
a
statement
said
the
firm
expects
to
pay
total
dividends
for
of
not
less
than
cents
a
share
on
the
expanded
capital
jardine
matheson
decided
to
withdraw
its
issue
because
of
a
joint
announcement
earlier
today
by
ronald
li
chairman
of
the
stock
exchange
of
hong
kong
and
securities
commissioner
ray
astin
that
the
listings
of
new
b
shares
would
be
barred
the
official
announcement
said
this
will
include
the
proposal
by
jardine
matheson
but
the
jardine
statement
quoted
chairman
simon
keswick
as
saying
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
issuing
of
b
shares
would
benefit
shareholders
and
regret
that
they
will
not
be
given
the
opportunity
to
vote
on
the
matter
at
this
stage
keswick
said
the
b
share
issue
will
benefit
jardine
matheson
s
shareholders
by
giving
the
firm
flexibility
to
issue
ordinary
shares
for
expansion
in
future
without
diluting
existing
shareholders
voting
rights
however
he
added
we
certainly
welcome
the
secretary
for
monetary
affairs
david
nendick
s
referral
of
this
very
important
matter
to
the
standing
committee
on
company
law
reform
and
are
hopeful
that
the
process
will
lead
to
the
development
of
general
principles
which
can
be
embraced

the

wallin
cautioned

not

estimates
for
the
company
as
he
said
medtronic
will
have
heavy

marketing
expenses
in

he
said
the
company
intends
to
reinvest
its
earnings
in
its
businesses
and
not
in

shareholders
are
better
off
if
we

rather

he

the

will
be
valued
at
about

double
that
by
wallin
said
our
objective
is
to
get
a
hold
of
new

and
start
building
market
share
if
we
have
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
to

in
the
past
medtronic
s
pacemakers
have
been
plagued
with
a
number
of
problems
leading
to
product
recalls
regulators
also
have
criticized
the
industry
citing
quality
problems
and
a
needless
overprescription
of
pacemakers
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
major
problems
in

we

the

chairman
sir
christopher
hogg
said
in
the
annual
repoprt
he
said
lengthy
negotiations
had
brought
agreement
with
the
tokyo
and
london
stock
exchanges
for
fuller
but
still
not
complete
access
to
market
data
through
reuter
services
many
other
markets
maintain
restrictions
he
added
hogg
said
members
of
some
markets
appear
to
believe
that
information
restrictions
protected
their
interests
in
other
cases
exchanges
seem
to
be
limiting
the
distribution
of
data
in
order
to
provide
competitive
advantage
to
their
own
commercial
information
businesses
he
also
noted
that
despite
increasing
liberalisation
in
the
telecommunications
field
some
countries
continue
to
protect
their
state
monopolies
at
the
expense
of
other
economic
sectors
reuter
dealing
services
remain
excluded
from
such
countries
as
a
result
banking
communities
serving
entire
economies
are
put
at
a
competitive
disadvantage

added

aegon

this

aegon
said
annuities
are
subject
to
such
strong

influences
that
it
should
be
accounted
differently
from
the
more
traditional

this
change
in

and
another
change
to
account
for

resulted

an

aegon
said
incidental
negative
influences
on

were
slightly
higher
being

high
initial

dutch

nv
said

to
maintain
for
a
number
of
years
a
similar
earnings
growth
to
the
pct
increase
in
net
profit
achieved
in
despite
continuing
investments
in
a
reorganization
program
and
efforts
to
extend
world
penetration
heineken
last
month
reported
a
net
profit
of
mln
guilders
after
mln
in
chairman
freddie
heineken
said
the
company
europe
s
leading
beer
producer
with
six
pct
of
market
share
in
said
sales
increased
by
pct
to
mln
hectoliters
the
volume
increase
was
due
mainly
to
a
rise
in
the
u
s
where
the
brand
amstel
lite
saw
great
demand
and
in
europe
where
sales
accounted
for
pct
of
the
total
turnover
despite
losses
in
guilder
terms
due
to
weaker
foreign
currencies
rose
by
pct
to
billion
guilders
further
consolidation
of
foreign
companies
including
the
increase
of
its
stake
in
leading
spanish
brewery
el
aguila
s
a
to
pct
new
ventures
and
modernization
particularly
in
french
and
spanish
interests
eroded
profit
margins
the
company
still
planned
to
invest
mln
guilders
this
year
in
restructuring
and
marketing
heineken
said
heineken
s
spanish
activities
should
start
yielding
profit
next
year
heineken
said
adding
that
its
french
operations
had
already
turned
to
profit
after
vast
rationalization
last
year
vice
chairman
gerard
van
schaik
said
the
decision
by
the
european
court
of
justice
in
luxembourg
to
allow
foreign
beer
into
the
closed
west
german
market
europe
s
biggest
beer
market
offered
interesting
possibilities
for
heineken
we
have
the
beer
but
distribution
and
sales
is
the
important
point
van
schaik
said
adding
that
since
the
ruling
heineken
had
been
inundated
by
german
traders
seeking
joint
ventures
the
question
is
not
if
we
want
to
penetrate
the
german
market
but
how
we
are
to
do
it
van
schaik
said
adding
that
while
the
widely
traveled
germans
seemed
to
be
developing
a
taste
for
foreign
beer
the
internal
structure
was
very
regionalized
heineken
board
member
hans
coebergh
responsible
for
african
operations
said
he
saw
africa
as
one
of
the
most
important
beer
growth
markets
in
the
long
term
he
said
the
company
present
in
africa
since
and
with
majority
stakes
in
six
breweries
and
interests
in
was
hampered
by
the
lack
of
hard
currencies
there
africa
where
beer
consumption
averages
only
nine
liters
per
head
per
year
and
sales
are
limited
by
import
restrictions
and
currency
risks
nonetheless
accounted
for
pct
of
total
sales
on
site
production
is
rendered
expensive
by
the
high
price
of
imports
of
essential
ingredients
but
heineken
scientists
have
been
looking
at
other
possibilities
to
balance
the
costs
of
imported
malt
heinken
launched
on
the
nigerian
market
a
new
beer
made
of
pct
sorghum
which
had
sold
successfully
coebergh
said
heineken
is
urging
farmers
to
grow
the
traditional
raw
materials
but
coebergh
noted
that
banana
and
palm
beer
were
popular
in
rwanda
this
is
a
possibility
but
we
could
not
possibly
achieve
the
heineken
flavor
coebergh
said
chairman
heineken
said
the
company
s
seven
year
efforts
to
penetrate
the
soviet
market
had
finally
resulted
this
week
in
a
contract
that
relaxed
some
of
the
restrictions
they
faced
but
again
a
lack
of
hard
currencies
limited
heineken
s
market
potential
heineken
now
has
seven

that
are
enjoying
good

said
its

adopted
a
warrant
dividend
plan
in
which
one
preferred
stock
purchase
right
will
be
distributed
as
a
dividend
on
each
common
share
outstanding
the
company
said
its
warrant
dividend
plan
is
designed
to
protect
its
shareholders
against
unsolicted
coercive
attempts
to
aquire
control
without
making
an
adequate
offer
for
all
shares
reichhold
said
the
adoption
is
not
a
response
to
any
specific
takeover
attempt
reichhold
said
each
right
will
entitle
shareholders
to
buy
one
one
hundreth
of
a
share
of
a
newly
created
series
of
preferred
stock
at
an
initial
exercise
price
of
dlrs
with
dividend
and
voting
rights
approximately
equal
to
those
of
one
share
of
the
company
s
common
stock
the
rights
will
be
exercisable
only
if
without
reichhold
s
prior
consent
a
person
or
group
a
acquires
pct
or
more
of
the
voting
power
or
announces
a
tender
offer
which
would
result
in

ownership
the
company
said
reichhold
said
it
is
entitled
to
redeem
the
rights
at
five
cts
apiece
before
a
pct
position
has
been
acquired
or
before
an
existing

shareholder
buys
an

two
pct

more
of

texaco
sees
business
little
hit
by
bankruptcy
move
houston
april
texaco
inc
tx
said
its
decision
to
file
for
protection
under
chapter
of
the
u
s
bankruptcy
code
will
not
affect
the
majority
of
its
businesses
it
said
its
subsidiaries
which
account
for
pct
of
its
billion
dlrs
in
revenues
and
pct
of
its
net
property
plant
and
equipment
were
free
of
the
action
only
parent
holding
company
texaco
inc
and
operating
subsidiaries
texaco
capital
inc
and
texaco
capital
n
v
are
affected
it
said
but
the
company
said
it
was
likely
to
suspend
its
cents
per
share
quarterly
common
stock
dividend
and
halt
repayments
on
debts
of
some
billion
dlrs
texaco
said
it
filed
for
chaper
because
suppliers
were
demanding
cash
payments
and
banks
were
withholding
loans
as
a
result
of
a
legal
dispute
with
pennzoil
co
pzl
texaco
is
fighting
a
texas
law
requiring
it
to
post
a
bond
of
more
than
billion
dlrs
before
it
can
appeal
a
judgment
that
ruled
it
illegally
interfered
with
pennzoil
s
acquisition
of
getty
petroleum
corp
gty
the
bond
almost
matches
the
damages
awarded
against
texaco
should
texaco
fail
to
place
the
bond
pennzoil
could
begin
to
attach
its
assets
to
secure
the
judgment
last
monday
the
supreme
court
overturned
a
decision
to
cut
texaco
s
bond
to
one
billion
dlrs
and
sent
the
issue
back
to
the
texas
courts
analysts
said
the
bankruptcy
filing
effectively
froze
all
texaco
s
obligations
while
it
continued
to
appeal
the
merits
of
the
pennzoil
lawsuit
attempts
last
week
to
win
a
compromise
on
both
the
bond
issue
and
the
larger
dispute
failed
james
kinnear
texaco
s
president
and
chief
executive
officer
told
reporters
kinnear
said
pennzoil
s
disclosure
in
court
papers
on
friday
that
it
wanted
to
extend
the
bond
issue
hearing
until
the
end
of
april
pushed
texaco
further
towards
chapter
pennzoil
had
asked
texaco
to
post
a
billion
dlr
cash
bond
and
to
reduce
its
dividend
to
not
more
than
pct
of
earnings
pennzoil
also
wanted
assurances
that
texaco
would
not
sell
any
assets
kinnear
said
texaco
offered
to
put
up
one
billion
dlrs
in
a
letter
of
credit
and
agreed
not
to
let
the
value
of
its
assets
fall
under
billion
dlrs
he
added
joseph
jamail
a
houston
attorney
for
pennzoil
said
the
company
had
made
its
latest
settlement
offer
to
texaco
on
saturday
and
was
taken
by
surprise
when
texaco
filed
for
bankruptcy
he
declined
to
reveal
the
amount
of
the
proposal
citing
a
confidentiality
agreement
between
the
two
companies
texaco
told
us
they
would
get
back
to
us
but
instead
they
chose
to
go
to
bankruptcy
court
jamail
said
attorneys
for
pennzoil
said
they
believed
the
company
would
prevail
in
court
appeals
adding
that
texaco
s
assets
were
ample
ultimately
to
pay
the
pennzoil
judgment

san

american
century
corp
said
it
has
restated
its
earnings
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
to
provide
an
additional
five
mln
dlrs
to
its
loan
loss
allowance
causing
a
restated
year
end
net
loss
of
dlrs
instead
of
dlrs
the
company
said
the
change
came
after
talks
with
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
on
the
company
s
judgement
in
considering
the
five
mln
dlrs
collectible
in
the
note
to
its
financial
statement
american
century
said
it
considered
the
five
mln
dlrs
collectible
making
its
loan
loss
provision
less
than
required
the
company
said
in
spite
of
the
sec
decision
it
still
feels
its
allowance
for
possible
loan
losses
at
june
was
adequate
and
that
it
has
considered
all
relevant
information
to
determine
the
collectibility
of
the
five
mln
dlr
receivable
but
it
said
continued
disagreement
with
the
sec
staff
would
not
be
in

jardine

replaces

hong

jardine

holdings
ltd
jard
hk
said
it
will
withdraw
the
previously
announced
four
for
one
bonus
issue
of
b
shares
and
replace
it
by
a
two
for
five

ordinary

statement
said
the
firm
expects
to
pay
total
dividends
for
of
not
less
than
cents
a
share
on
the
expanded
capital
jardine
matheson
decided
to
withdraw
its
issue
because
of
a
joint
announcement
earlier
today
by
ronald
li
chairman
of
the
stock
exchange
of
hong
kong
and
securities
commissioner
ray
astin
that
the
listings
of
new
b
shares
would
be
barred
the
official
announcement
said
this
will
include
the
proposal
by
jardine
matheson
but
the
jardine
statement
quoted
chairman
simon
keswick
as
saying
we
continue
to
believe
that
the
issuing
of
b
shares
would
benefit
shareholders
and
regret
that
they
will
not
be
given
the
opportunity
to
vote
on
the
matter
at
this
stage
keswick
said
the
b
share
issue
will
benefit
jardine
matheson
s
shareholders
by
giving
the
firm
flexibility
to
issue
ordinary
shares
for
expansion
in
future
without
diluting
existing
shareholders
voting
rights
however
he
added
we
certainly
welcome
the
secretary
for
monetary
affairs
david
nendick
s
referral
of
this
very
important
matter
to
the
standing
committee
on
company
law
reform
and
are
hopeful
that
the
process
will
lead
to
the
development
of
general
principles
which
can
be
embraced

morgan
and

said
its

largely
reflecting
its
previously
announced
decision
to

its

of

loans
to

that
decision
spurred
by
brazil

on

reduced

in

earlier
period
in

posted
other

wallin
cautioned

not

change
their
per

estimates
for
the
company
as
he
said
medtronic
will
have
heavy

and
marketing
expenses
in

he
said
the
company
intends
to
reinvest
its
earnings
in
its
businesses
and
not
in
its
dividends
shareholders
are
better
off
if
we
grow
the
business
rather
than
reinvest

he

said
he

he
said
the
worldwide
market
for
cardiovascualr
therapeutic
products
which
includes
pacemakers
valves
catheters
and
lasers
will
be
valued
at
about
billion
dlrs
and
will
double
that
by
wallin
said
our
objective
is
to
get
a
hold
of
new
products
and
start
building
market
share
if
we
have
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
to
get
into
new

in
the
past
medtronic
s
pacemakers
have
been
plagued
with
a
number
of
problems
leading
to
product
recalls
regulators
also
have
criticized
the
industry
citing
quality
problems
and
a
needless
overprescription
of
pacemakers
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
major
problems
in

we
intend

wallin

the

exchanges

authorities
should
abolish
their

to

reuters

rtrs
l
chairman
sir
christopher
hogg
said
in
the
annual
repoprt
he
said
lengthy
negotiations
had
brought
agreement
with
the
tokyo
and
london
stock
exchanges
for
fuller
but
still
not
complete
access
to
market
data
through
reuter
services
many
other
markets
maintain
restrictions
he
added
hogg
said
members
of
some
markets
appear
to
believe
that
information
restrictions
protected
their
interests
in
other
cases
exchanges
seem
to
be
limiting
the
distribution
of
data
in
order
to
provide
competitive
advantage
to
their
own
commercial
information
businesses
he
also
noted
that
despite
increasing
liberalisation
in
the
telecommunications
field
some
countries
continue
to
protect
their
state
monopolies
at
the
expense
of
other
economic
sectors
reuter
dealing
services
remain
excluded
from
such
countries
as
a
result
banking
communities
serving
entire
economies
are
put
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
he
added
reuters
increased
its

was
eight

lower
in
at

vs

in
the

said
its

were
down
due
to

a

it
added
that

would
have
risen
by
about

not

revenue

revenue

from

insurance

aegon
said
this
was
due
to
a
change
in
accounting
for
u
s

aegon
said
annuities
are
subject
to
such
strong
personal
investment
influences
that
it
should
be
accounted
differently
from
the
more
traditional
insurances
this
change
in
accounting
practice
and
another
change
to
account
for
profits
made
on
fixed
interest
investments
resulted
in
an
incidental
rise
in
net
profits
of

guilders
aegon
said
incidental
negative
influences
on
net
profits
were
slightly
higher
being
the
lower
dollar
rate
high
initial
costs
for

and
the

the

its

natural

unit
which
has
less
take

exposure
than
most
major

should
show
improvement

of
changes

the

last

williams
also
said
it
expected

heineken
sees
higher

amsterdam
april
dutch
brewer
heineken
nv
said
it
hoped
to
maintain
for
a
number
of
years
a
similar
earnings
growth
to
the
pct
increase
in
net
profit
achieved
in
despite
continuing
investments
in
a
reorganization
program
and
efforts
to
extend
world
penetration
heineken
last
month
reported
a
net
profit
of
mln
guilders
after
mln
in
chairman
freddie
heineken
said
the
company
europe
s
leading
beer
producer
with
six
pct
of
market
share
in
said
sales
increased
by
pct
to
mln
hectoliters
the
volume
increase
was
due
mainly
to
a
rise
in
the
u
s
where
the
brand
amstel
lite
saw
great
demand
and
in
europe
where
sales
accounted
for
pct
of
the
total
turnover
despite
losses
in
guilder
terms
due
to
weaker
foreign
currencies
rose
by
pct
to
billion
guilders
further
consolidation
of
foreign
companies
including
the
increase
of
its
stake
in
leading
spanish
brewery
el
aguila
s
a
to
pct
new
ventures
and
modernization
particularly
in
french
and
spanish
interests
eroded
profit
margins
the
company
still
planned
to
invest
mln
guilders
this
year
in
restructuring
and
marketing
heineken
said
heineken
s
spanish
activities
should
start
yielding
profit
next
year
heineken
said
adding
that
its
french
operations
had
already
turned
to
profit
after
vast
rationalization
last
year
vice
chairman
gerard
van
schaik
said
the
decision
by
the
european
court
of
justice
in
luxembourg
to
allow
foreign
beer
into
the
closed
west
german
market
europe
s
biggest
beer
market
offered
interesting
possibilities
for
heineken
we
have
the
beer
but
distribution
and
sales
is
the
important
point
van
schaik
said
adding
that
since
the
ruling
heineken
had
been
inundated
by
german
traders
seeking
joint
ventures
the
question
is
not
if
we
want
to
penetrate
the
german
market
but
how
we
are
to
do
it
van
schaik
said
adding
that
while
the
widely
traveled
germans
seemed
to
be
developing
a
taste
for
foreign
beer
the
internal
structure
was
very
regionalized
heineken
board
member
hans
coebergh
responsible
for
african
operations
said
he
saw
africa
as
one
of
the
most
important
beer
growth
markets
in
the
long
term
he
said
the
company
present
in
africa
since
and
with
majority
stakes
in
six
breweries
and
interests
in
was
hampered
by
the
lack
of
hard
currencies
there
africa
where
beer
consumption
averages
only
nine
liters
per
head
per
year
and
sales
are
limited
by
import
restrictions
and
currency
risks
nonetheless
accounted
for
pct
of
total
sales
on
site
production
is
rendered
expensive
by
the
high
price
of
imports
of
essential
ingredients
but
heineken
scientists
have
been
looking
at
other
possibilities
to
balance
the
costs
of
imported
malt
heinken
launched
on
the
nigerian
market
a
new
beer
made
of
pct
sorghum
which
had
sold
successfully
coebergh
said
heineken
is
urging
farmers
to
grow
the
traditional
raw
materials
but
coebergh
noted
that
banana
and
palm
beer
were
popular
in
rwanda
this
is
a
possibility
but
we
could
not
possibly
achieve
the
heineken
flavor
coebergh
said
chairman
heineken
said
the
company
s
seven
year
efforts
to
penetrate
the
soviet
market
had
finally
resulted
this
week
in
a
contract
that
relaxed
some
of
the
restrictions
they
faced
but
again
a
lack
of
hard
currencies
limited
heineken
s
market
potential
heineken
now
has
seven
bars
in
moscow
that
are
enjoying
good
sales
but
the
bars
only
accept

on

said
its

an
adequate
offer
for
all

reichhold
said
the
adoption

rights
approximately
equal
to

the

will

code

it

its

which
account
for
pct

was
likely
to
suspend
its
cents
per
share
quarterly
common
stock
dividend
and
halt
repayments
on
debts
of
some
billion

texaco
said
it
filed
for
chaper
because
suppliers
were
demanding
cash
payments
and
banks
were
withholding
loans
as
a
result
of
a
legal
dispute
with
pennzoil
co
pzl
texaco
is
fighting
a
texas
law
requiring
it
to
post
a
bond
of
more
than
billion
dlrs
before
it
can
appeal
a
judgment
that
ruled
it
illegally
interfered
with
pennzoil
s
acquisition
of
getty
petroleum
corp
gty
the
bond
almost
matches
the
damages
awarded
against
texaco
should
texaco
fail
to
place
the
bond
pennzoil
could
begin
to
attach
its
assets
to
secure
the
judgment
last
monday
the
supreme
court
overturned
a
decision
to
cut
texaco
s
bond
to
one
billion
dlrs
and
sent
the
issue
back
to
the
texas
courts
analysts
said
the
bankruptcy
filing
effectively
froze
all
texaco
s
obligations
while
it
continued
to
appeal
the
merits
of
the
pennzoil
lawsuit
attempts
last
week
to
win
a
compromise
on
both
the
bond
issue
and
the
larger
dispute
failed
james
kinnear
texaco
s
president
and
chief
executive
officer
told
reporters
kinnear
said
pennzoil
s
disclosure
in
court
papers
on
friday
that
it
wanted
to
extend
the
bond
issue
hearing
until
the
end
of
april
pushed
texaco
further
towards
chapter
pennzoil
had
asked
texaco
to
post
a
billion
dlr
cash
bond
and
to
reduce
its
dividend
to
not
more
than
pct
of
earnings
pennzoil
also
wanted
assurances
that
texaco
would
not
sell
any
assets
kinnear
said
texaco
offered
to
put
up
one
billion
dlrs
in
a
letter
of
credit
and
agreed
not

the

the

came
after

the

in

of
the

it
still
feels
its

for
possible

at

was
adequate

that
it

to
determine
the
collectibility
of
the

it
said
continued

vw
linked
to
an
alleged

fraud
will
not

provision
already
made
a
vw
spokesman
said
the
spokesman
was
commenting
after
vw
had
confirmed
it
would
pay
an
unchanged
mark
dividend
for
ordinary
shares
on
business
despite
the
provision
one
west
german
newspaper
today
quoted
foreign
currency
dealers
in
frankfurt
as
speculating
that
the
total
losses
from
the
currency
affair
could
be
as
high
as
billion
marks
but
the
vw
spokesman
described
mln
marks
as
an
upper
limit
vw
said
in
a
statement
following
today
s
supervisory
board
meeting
that
it
had
discussed
the
foreign
currency
scandal
in
detail
and
was
setting
up
a
new
probe
into
its
foreign
currency
activities
to
be
carried
out
by
an
unnamed
auditing
company
vw
has
said
computer
programs
were
erased
and
documents
were
faked
in
the
alleged
fraud
in
which
it
believes
transactions
intended
to
protect
it
against
possible
foreign
currency
losses
were
not
completed
vw
s
former
foreign
currency
chief
burkhard
junger
was
arrested
on
monday
on
suspicion
of
embezzlement
and
of
having
evaded
justice
earlier
vw
had
said
that
its
results
would
match
profits
vw
s
group
net
profit
in

and
parent
company
net

it
also
said
it
recommend
an

to
the
supervisory
board
the
company
has
also
set
a
dividend
of
marks
for
new
preference
shares
which
were
issued
last
year
analysts
have
described
the
held
dividend
as
a
move
to
reassure
worried
shareholders
vw
increased
nominal
capital
by
marks
last
year
to
billion
marks
with
the
result
that
its
total
dividend
payment
on
will
be
mln

compared
with

on
since
the
new
capital
was
in

the

analysts
say

will
have

the

the

ibm
ibm
new
york
april
international
business
machines
corp
has
started
the
year
aggressively
but
industry
analysts
said
the
company
still
faces
some
tough
rounds
in
its
fight
to
stop
a
two
year
earnings
slump
i
am
more
impressed
with
what
s
happening
at
ibm
than
i
have
been
in
a
long
time
said
painewebber
analyst
stephen
smith
but
they
re
not
out
of
the
woods
yet
he
added
at
dlrs
a
share
ibm
s
first
quarter
net
income
easily
topped
most
estimates
on
wall
street
which
had
ranged
from
an
even
dollar
to
dlrs
most
analysts
said
they
were
pleasantly
surprised
by
ibm
s
performance
but
they
indicated
that
ibm
s
chances
for
a
full
recovery
hinged
on
several
key
factors
whose
impact
will
not
be
felt
until
later
in
the
year
these
include
the
success
of
ibm
s
new
personal
computer
line
introduced
two
weeks
ago
and
its
minicomputers
which
will
begin
volume
shipments
in
july
in
addition
ibm
has
said
the
full
benefits
of
its
early
retirement
program
and
other
cost
cutting
moves
will
emerge
as
the
year
progresses
analysts
noted
that
ibm
chairman
john
f
akers
was
relatively
more
upbeat
in
assessing
the
company
s
outlook
than
he
has
been
for
nearly
a
year
although
the
worldwide
economic
situation
remains
unsettled
there
are
some
encouraging
signs
in
our
business
akers
said
pointing
to
among
other
things
higher
first
quarter
shipments
we
remain
optimistic
about
the
prospects
for
both
the
industry
and
ibm
he
said
akers
was
most
encouraging
said
painewebber
s
smith
a
weak
dollar
a
lower
tax
rate
and
strong
mainframe
computer
sales
all
contributed
to
the
better
than
expected
first
quarter
results
analysts
said
shipments
of
the
mainframes
were
very
strong
in
march
after
a
weak
january
and
february
said
ulric
weil
of
washington
based

sales
of
the

mainframes
commonly
