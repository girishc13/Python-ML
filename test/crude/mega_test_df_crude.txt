lukman
sees
stable

price
for

stockholm

the
current
crude
oil
price
of
between
and
dlrs
a
barrel
will
remain
stable
over
the
next
couple
of
years
rising
only
one
to
two
dlrs
a

per
annum
to
keep
up
with
inflation
opec
president
rilwanu
lukman
said
lukman
who
was
speaking
during
talks
with
swedish
trade
officials
said
the
stable
price
depended
upon
output
restraint
by
both
opec
and
non
opec
oil
producers
swedish
government
officials
said
they
said
lukman
who
is
also
nigerian
oil
minister
made
the
remarks
whilst
talking
about
the
connection
between
third
world
debt
and
industrialised
nations
crude
oil
output
controls
did
not
necessarily
mean
higher
energy
bills
for
the
world
s
industrial
nations
lukman
said
although
very
low
oil
prices
such
as
those
seen
around
the
beginning
of
the
year
may
appear
beneficial
for
the
industrial
countries
that
depend
on
imported
energy
they
would
only
lead
to
wastage
and
overdependence
on
the
fuel
in
the
long
term
he
said
this
in
turn
would
bring
a
swing
back
to
extremely
high
prices
he
added
sweden
heavily
dependent
on

suffered

even
though
most

do
not
expect
any

changes
from
the

they
said
prices
which
have
steadily
climbed
since
the

in

have
risen
on

factors
within

about

of

which
could

opec
conference
president
rilwanu
lukman
who
is
nigeria
s
oil
minister
said
friday
he
expects
the
meeting
in
vienna
to
be
brief
and
calm
and
that
opec
s
current
price
and
production
agreement
may
only
need
a
slight
review
although
most
industry
experts
expect
just
a
reaffirmation
of
the
december
agreement
oil
prices
continue
to
climb
due
to
a
desire
to
hedge
positions
in
case
of
any
surprises
analysts
expect
the
higher
prices
to
continue
until
soon
after
the
opec
meeting
at
that
point
barring
any
increased
tension
in
the
gulf
or
changes
in
opec
s
policies
prices
should
begin
easing
opec
will
probably
not
do
anything
it
hasn
t
already
agreed
to
in
december
because
oil
prices
are
firm
said
john
hill
a
vice
president
at
merrill
lynch
futures
opec
agreed
in
december
to
maintain
official
oil
prices
at
dlrs
a
barrel
and
raise
the
group
s
production
ceiling
to
mln
barrels
per
day
in
the
third
quarter
and
to
mln
barrels
in
the
fourth
quarter
this
agreement
helped
send
prices
sharply
higher
rising
from
dlrs
a
barrel
in
early
december
several
opec
members
who
are
price
hawks
including
iran
algeria
and
libya
will
seek
a
higher
official
price
and
a
reduction
in
output
and
if
u
s
west
texas
intermediate
crude
continues
to
trade
above
dlrs
a
barrel
there
is
a
greater
chance
that
opec
will
raise
its
official
dlrs
price
said
nauman
barakat
analyst
at
smith
barney
harris
upham
and
co
but
most
analysts
expect
the
more
moderate
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
to
block
any
changes
in
policy
the
meeting
will
be
a
non
event
with
no
change
in
the
official
prices
because
opec
and
in
particular
the
saudis
are
committed
to
stabilizing
the
market
said
rosario
ilacqua
analyst
with
l
f
rothschild
however
some
analysts
said
opec
may
need
to
hold
a
meeting
in
september
to
re
evaluate
market
conditions
overproduction
by
opec
will
become
a
real
problem
in
the
fourth
quarter
when
the
quota
is
raised
to
mln
barrels
a
day
and
iraq
s
pipeline
through
turkey
brings
another
barrels
to
the
market
each
day
said
john
lichtblau
president
of
petroleum
industry
ressearch
foundation
most
expect
saudi
arabia
to
oppose
a
price
increase
at
this
meeting
but
many
look
for
an
increase
by
year
end
to
dlrs
to
offset
the
decline
in
the
dollar
oil
prices
are
denominated
throughout
the
world
in
dollars
so
as
the
currency
declines
producers
receive
less
money
for
their
oil
the
only
real
production
restraint
in
opec
is
saudi
arabia
said
sanford
margoshes
analyst
at
shearson
lehman
brothers
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
we
expect
the
saudis
not
to
produce
at
their
mln
barrel
a
day
quota
and
therefore
act
as
a
vehicle
to
stablize
the
market
and
pave
the
way
for
a
two
dlrs
a
barrel
price
increase
at
the
december
meeting
he
said
one
uncertain
factor
is
the
course
of
the
iran
iraq
war
the
wild
card
is
the
increased
tensions
in
the
persian
gulf
said
frank

with

securites
oil
tankers

the

extra

are

during

opec
differentials
not
seen
posing
major
problems
london
june
some
opec
states
are
unhappy
about
the
prices
assigned
to
their
crude
oil
but
this
should
not
pose
great
problems
when
the
group
reviews
its
six
month
old
price
and
output
pact
in
vienna
next
week
oil
analysts
say
they
said
nigeria
which
holds
the
opec
conference
presidency
and
qatar
probably
have
the
biggest
grievances
about
price
differentials
making
some
of
their
crudes
uncompetitive
there
has
also
been
speculation
by
japanese
traders
that
opec
might
want
to
mark
up
prices
of
high
sulphur
heavy
crudes
to
correspond
with
greater
demand
and
higher
fuel
oil
prices
but
most
experts
agree
that
a
major
overhaul
of
price
differentials
is
unlikely
so
as
to
avoid
giving
the
market
signals
of
a
dent
in
opec
s
new
unity
all
opec
members
can
make
a
good
case
for
changing
differentials
said
one
analyst
with
a
major
oil
company
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
attitude
is
going
to
be
leave
well
alone
and
little
or
nothing
is
likely
to
be
altered
iran
libya
and
saudi
arabia
are
among
those
who
also
saw
sales
problems
earlier
this
year
traders
say
but
diminished
customer
resistance
to
fixed
prices
and
in
some
cases
marketing
incentives
have
helped
their
sales
some
producers
can
sell
uncompetitively
priced
crudes
by
means
of
discounts
processing
deals
or
selling
them
alongside
better
priced
grades
in
a
package
many
opec
crudes
are
seen
to
be
reasonably
priced
at
least
for
some
part
of
the
year
but
many
experts
say
opec
should
change
prices
quarterly
or
monthly
to
match
seasonal
demand
for
fuel
oil
rich
heavy
crudes
and
gasoline
rich
lighter
grades
at
its
last
meeting
in

opec

to

around
an
dlr
per

reference
point
official
prices
had
been
effectively
dropped
in
when
members
offered
discounts
to
attract
customers
opec
also
decided
to
limit
first
half
output
to
mln
bpd
and
proposed
ceilings
of
mln
for
the
third
quarter
and

for
the
fourth
analysts
expect
it
will
now
extend
or
raise
slightly
the
current
ceiling
for
the
coming
months
spot
market
and
netback
values
for
some
crudes
do
not
mirror
official
prices
but
opec
will
probably
keep
the
dlr
target
and
at
most
make
minimal
changes
to
differentials
analysts
say
the
dlr
figure
is
based
on
a
basket
of
six
opec
and
one
non
opec
crudes
opec
assigned
prices
to
its
other
key
export
crudes
with
a
dlr
gap
between
the
heaviest
and

extra
heavy
crudes
were
among
those
left
out
industry
estimates
vary
on
the
proportion
of
opec
oil
exports
actually
sold
at
official
prices
several
experts
say
only
one
quarter
to
one
third
of
the
total
in
fact
sells
at
official
prices
with
some
of
the
rest
included
in

or
barter
deals
or
sold
in
the
form
of
refined
products
problems
with
the
new
structure
appeared
earlier
this

when
some

output
fell
due
to
customer
reluctance
to

opec

he
said
he
said
opec
had
to
look
very
carefully
at
what

of

in
the

would
effectively
sustain
the

that
an
increase
to

will

a

in

lajous
said
a
repetition
of
what
happened
last

when
opec
boosted
output
and
sent

prices
tumbling
down
below

is
always
there

will
be

he
said
lajous
said
there
was
still
excess
supply
and
as
long
as
this
remains
there
will
be
a

instability
in

should
remain

oil
sources

the

that

they

been
firming
up
significantly
thus
consolidating
the

structure
as
defined
by

the
conference
examined
the
supply
demand
outlook
for
the
second

of
the

and
decided
that
in
order
to
secure
continued

in

opec

during

fourth

of

be
equal

distributed
into
the
same
national

levels
as
were
defined
by
the
above
mentioned
agreement
for
that
quarter
furthermore
the
conference
decided
to
establish
a
committee
of
five
heads
of
delegation
to
monitor
the
price
evolution
in
the
market
in
relation
to
the
opec
official
prices
in
order
to
secure
price
stability
around
the
opec
price
structure
should
there
be
any
significant
change
in
market
prices
the
committee
would
immediately
call
for
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
conference
with
a
view
to
deciding
on
the
necessary
opec
production
levels
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
which
would
secure
the
desired
market
stability
the
conference
reiterated
the
necessity
of
member
countries
strict
adherence
to
the
agreement
signed
in
december
both
in
terms
of
official
price
and
national
production
levels
for
this
purpose
the
conference
decided
to
establish
a
committee
of
three
heads
of
delegation
to
undertake
visits
to
member
countries
in
order
to
motivate
them
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
moreover
the
conference
stressed
the
necessity
of
the
cooperation
of
the
oil
producing
exporting
countries
outside
opec
as
an
essential
prerequisite
for
a
lasting
market
stability
the
conference
therefore
decided
to
reinstate
the
group
of
five
heads
of

established
by
the
extraordinary
meeting
of
the

in
april
to
undertake
the
necessary
contacts
with
those
countries
the

observed
the

predicted
iran
will
retaliate
for
the
u

strike
against
its

platform
though
he
said
iranian
options
were
limited
they
will
be
determined
they
will
not
be
easily
deterred
and
let
me
stress
for
you
that
our
commitment
there
is
not
going
to
be
risk
free
or
casualty
free
he
said
the
most
likely
iranian
response
would
involve
terrorism
or
the
laying
of
mines
they
obviously
will
look
for
ways
that
are
probably
more
in
line
with
the
silent
hand
than
what
they
have
tried
thus

crowe
told

he

the

the

he
said

he
said
less
than
half

had
been
in

the

off
would
have
produced

later

experts

u

destroyed

and

to
an
iranian
silkworm
missile
attack
last

on

private

generally
agreed
that
going
after
the
rig
rather
than
an
onshore
economic
or
military
target
such
as
silkworm
launch
sites
reflected
a
careful
bid
by
washington
to
limit
the
political
military
and
diplomatic
fallout
both
at

norman

a

he
said
hitting

had
spared
iran
the
embarrassment
of
casualties
on
its
own
soil
possibly
avoiding
an
escalating
spiral
of
attack
and
counterattack
in
addition
it
minimized
the

the

anthony
cordesman
author

on
the

iraq
war
said
the

apparently
chose
a
limited
target
to
keep
alive
the

that

secretary

javier
perez

still
persuade

he

that

made
it
clear
tougher
steps
would
follow
if
iran
to
attack
gulf
shipping
in
targeting
an
oil
rig
albeit
one
said
by
the
pentagon
to
have
been
turned

washington
also
sent
a
message
that
it
might
be
willing

pentagon
officials
said
the

had
been
used
as
a
base
for
iranian
raids
against

in

we
have
chosen
a

but
we
also
have
shown
iran
that

ruled
that

provisions
a

makes
for

are
not
tax
deductible
the
press
association
reported
the
company
was
appealing
against
a
decision
of
the
tax
commissioners
that
any
such
provision
was
a
capital
expenditure
not
a
revenue
expenditure
and
was
not

was
told

made

provision
of
around

for
the
eventual
cost
of
abandoning

an

the
ruling
was
not
worrying
as
the
subsidiary
had
assumed
that
the
provisions
were
not
deductible
from
corporation
tax
payable
it
would
have
been
a
bonus
if

not

analysts
said
that
rtz
s
assumption
of
liability
was
shared
by
the
industry
as
a
whole
the
ruling
appeared
to
mean
that
tax
relief
on
the
expensive
process
of
abandoning
rigs
would
apply
when
the

occurred

the

that

he

the

at

the

lukman
said
although
very
low

such

may
appear
beneficial
for
the

they
would

they
said

he

to
be
brief
and
calm
and
that
opec
s
current
price

production
agreement
may
only
need
a
slight
review
although
most
industry
experts
expect
just
a
reaffirmation
of
the
december
agreement
oil
prices
continue
to
climb
due
to
a
desire
to
hedge
positions
in
case
of
any
surprises
analysts
expect
the
higher
prices
to
continue
until
soon
after
the
opec
meeting
at
that
point
barring
any
increased
tension
in
the

or
changes
in
opec
s
policies
prices

begin

opec
will
probably
not
do

it

already
agreed

because
oil
prices
are
firm
said
john
hill
a
vice
president
at

opec
agreed
in
december
to
maintain
official
oil
prices
at

and
raise
the
group
s
production
ceiling
to
mln
barrels
per
day
in
the
third
quarter
and
to

barrels
in
the
fourth
quarter
this
agreement
helped
send
prices
sharply
higher
rising
from
dlrs
a
barrel
in
early
december
several
opec
members
who
are
price
hawks
including
iran
algeria
and
libya
will
seek
a
higher
official
price
and
a
reduction
in
output
and
if
u
s
west
texas
intermediate
crude
continues
to
trade
above
dlrs
a
barrel
there
is
a
greater
chance
that
opec
will
raise
its
official
dlrs
price
said
nauman
barakat
analyst
at
smith
barney
harris
upham
and
co
but
most
analysts
expect
the
more
moderate
producers
such
as
saudi
arabia
to
block
any
changes
in
policy
the
meeting
will
be
a
non
event
with
no
change
in
the
official
prices
because
opec
and
in
particular
the
saudis
are
committed
to
stabilizing
the
market
said
rosario
ilacqua
analyst
with
l
f
rothschild
however
some
analysts
said
opec
may
need
to
hold
a
meeting
in
september
to
re
evaluate
market
conditions
overproduction
by
opec
will
become
a
real
problem
in
the
fourth

when
the
quota
is
raised
to

barrels
a

and
iraq

pipeline

said
john
lichtblau
president
of

industry
ressearch
foundation
most
expect
saudi
arabia
to
oppose
a
price
increase
at
this
meeting
but
many
look
for
an
increase
by
year
end
to
dlrs
to
offset
the
decline
in
the
dollar
oil
prices
are
denominated
throughout
the
world
in
dollars
so
as
the
currency
declines
producers
receive
less
money
for
their
oil
the
only
real
production
restraint
in
opec
is
saudi
arabia
said
sanford
margoshes
analyst
at
shearson
lehman
brothers
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
we
expect
the
saudis
not
to
produce
at
their
mln
barrel
a

quota
and
therefore
act
as
a
vehicle
to
stablize
the
market
and
pave
the
way
for
a
two
dlrs
a
barrel
price
increase
at
the
december
meeting
he
said
one
uncertain
factor
is
the
course
of
the
iran
iraq
war
the
wild
card
is
the
increased

london

some
opec
states

about

this
should
not
pose
great
problems
when
the

oil
analysts
say
they
said
nigeria
which
holds
the
opec
conference
presidency
and
qatar
probably
have
the
biggest
grievances
about
price
differentials
making
some
of
their
crudes
uncompetitive
there
has
also
been
speculation
by
japanese
traders
that
opec
might
want
to
mark
up
prices
of
high
sulphur
heavy
crudes
to
correspond
with
greater
demand
and
higher
fuel
oil
prices
but
most
experts
agree
that
a
major
overhaul
of
price
differentials
is
unlikely
so
as
to
avoid
giving
the
market
signals
of
a
dent
in
opec
s
new
unity
all
opec
members
can
make
a
good
case
for
changing
differentials
said
one
analyst
with
a
major
oil
company
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
attitude
is
going
to
be
leave
well
alone
and
little
or
nothing
is
likely
to
be
altered
iran
libya
and
saudi
arabia
are
among
those
who
also
saw
sales
problems
earlier
this
year
traders
say
but
diminished
customer
resistance
to
fixed
prices
and
in
some
cases
marketing
incentives
have
helped
their
sales
some
producers
can
sell
uncompetitively
priced
crudes
by
means
of
discounts
processing
deals
or
selling
them
alongside
better
priced
grades
in
a
package
many
opec
crudes
are
seen
to
be
reasonably
priced
at
least
for
some
part
of
the
year
but
many
experts
say
opec
should
change
prices
quarterly
or
monthly
to
match
seasonal
demand
for
fuel

rich
heavy
crudes
and
gasoline
rich
lighter

opec

official

offered

to

customers
opec
also

to

half
output
to

bpd
and
proposed
ceilings
of

for
the
third

now
extend

slightly
the

ceiling
for
the
coming

spot
market
and
netback
values
for
some
crudes

opec
will
probably
keep
the
dlr
target
and
at
most
make
minimal
changes
to
differentials
analysts

the
dlr
figure
is
based
on
a

of

opec
and

of

a

he
said
he
said
opec
had
to
look
very
carefully
at
what

of

in

sustain

that
an

lajous
said
a
repetition
of
what
happened
last

when
opec
boosted
output
and
sent

prices
tumbling
down
below

is
always
there

a

expect

have
learned
their
lessons
and

will
be
maintained
he
said
lajous
said
there
was
still
excess
supply
and
as
long
as
this
remains
there
will
be
a

instability
in

a

that

by
opec
members
such
as
iraq

kuwait

demand
should
exceed

spot

this
will

further
said
a
japanese
oil
trader
some
tokyo
traders
were
cautious
about
whether
thu
spot
market
has
further
upward
potential
in
the
short
term
having
risen
strongly
on
the
opec
news
on
friday
you
could
certainly
argue
that
if
new

rose
on
that
basis
there
s
no
reason
for
prices
to
go
up
again
today
said
one
international
oil
trader
in
tokyo
but
i
think
if
there
s
any
sign
of
a
dip
it
will
be
bought
back
up
again
pretty
quickly
he
added
one
oil
industry
analyst
concurred
there
is
no
reason
to
expect
a
weak
market
from
now
on
he
said
he
expected
opec
to
raise
prices
to
dlrs
when
it
meets
on
december
oil
sources
said
spot
prices
are
unlikely
to
surge
strongly
in
the
next
few
months
due
to
cheating
by
some
opec
members
and
the
likelihood
that
saudi
arabia
will
act
as
swing
producer
to
maintain
steady
prices
iraq
is
currently
producing
around
two
mln
barrels
per
day
compared
to
its
second
half
quota
of
mln
they
said
its
export
capability
will
rise
to
mln
bpd
when
a
new
pipeline
through
turkey
comes
onstream
in
or
around
september
qatar
is
said
to
be
achieving
sales
of
around
bpd
against
its
opec
assigned
quota
of
by
discounting
up
to
cents
a
barrel
from
official
prices
the
sources
said
iran
the
united
arab
emirates
and
kuwait
are
also
cheating
on
the
opec
agreement
with
over
production
and
effective
price
discounts
through
counter
purchases
industry
sources
said
but
they
mostly
agreed
that
saudi
arabia
will
unofficially
act
as
swing
producer
cutting
production
to
compensate
for
higher
output
by
other
members
or
boosting
output
if
spot
prices
rise
too
high
too
fast
saudi
arabia
has
a
floating

stockpile

saudi

wants

following
are
extracts
from
the
communique
issued
at
the
conclusion
of
the
opec
conference
here
the
conference
expressed
satisfaction
about
the
positive
results
of
the
agreement
signed
in
december
by
which
opec
re
established
the
system
of
fixed
price
at
a
level
of
dlrs
per
barrel
supported
by
opec
production
ceilings
distributed
into
national
production
levels
the
conference
noted
that
all
market
indicators
including
spot
prices
in
the
market
and
netback
values
of
all
opec
crudes
have
been
firming
up
significantly
thus
consolidating
the
opec
price
structure
as
defined
by
the
agreement
the
conference
examined
the
supply
demand
outlook
for
the
second
half
of
the
year
and
decided
that
in
order
to
secure
continued
firm
prices
in
the
market
opec
production
during
the
fourth
quarter
of
will
be
equal
to
that
of
the
third
quarter
i
e
mln
barrels
per
day
bpd
distributed
into
the
same
national
production
levels
as
were
defined
by
the
above
mentioned
agreement
for
that
quarter
furthermore
the
conference
decided
to
establish
a
committee
of
five
heads
of
delegation
to
monitor
the
price
evolution
in
the
market
in
relation
to
the
opec
official
prices
in
order
to
secure
price
stability
around
the
opec
price
structure
should
there
be
any
significant
change
in
market
prices
the
committee
would
immediately
call
for
an
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
conference
with
a
view
to
deciding
on
the
necessary
opec
production
levels
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
which
would
secure
the
desired
market
stability
the
conference
reiterated
the
necessity
of
member
countries
strict
adherence
to
the
agreement
signed
in
december
both
in
terms
of
official
price
and
national
production
levels
for
this
purpose
the
conference
decided
to
establish
a
committee
of
three
heads
of
delegation
to
undertake
visits
to
member
countries
in
order
to
motivate
them
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
moreover
the
conference
stressed
the
necessity
of
the
cooperation
of
the
oil
producing
exporting
countries
outside
opec
as
an
essential
prerequisite
for
a
lasting
market
stability
the
conference
therefore
decided
to
reinstate
the
group
of
five
heads
of
delegation
established
by
the
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
conference
in
april
to
undertake
the
necessary
contacts
with
those
countries
the
conference
observed
the
continued
fall
in

of

and
agreed
that
the

should
be

the

discussed
the

predicted
iran
will
retaliate
for
the

against
its

platform
though
he
said
iranian
options
were
limited
they
will
be
determined
they
will
not
be
easily
deterred
and
let
me
stress
for
you
that
our
commitment
there
is
not
going
to
be
risk
free
or
casualty
free
he
said
the
most
likely
iranian
response
would
involve
terrorism
or
the
laying
of
mines
they
obviously
will
look
for
ways
that
are
probably
more
in

with
the
silent
hand
than
what
they
have
tried
thus

crowe
told

he

it

the

he
said
less
than
half

the

analyst
and
author
said
he
said
hitting

had
spared
iran
the
embarrassment
of
casualties
on
its
own
soil
possibly
avoiding
an
escalating
spiral
of
attack
and
counterattack
in
addition
it
minimized
the
risk
to
u

and
the
potential
embarrassment
of
any
losses
including

that
could
have
been
shot

anthony
cordesman
author
of
a

book
on
the
iran
iraq
war
said
the
united
states
apparently
chose
a
limited
target
to
keep
alive
the
possibility
that
u

secretary
general
javier
perez
de
cuellar
might
still
persuade
iran
to
accept
a

call
for

we

initiative
to

there
s
any

at

he
said
adding
that
the
action
made
it
clear
tougher
steps
would
follow
if
iran
to
attack
gulf

in
targeting
an
oil
rig
albeit

said
by
the

to
have
been
turned
into

post
washington
also
sent
a
message
that
it
might
be
willing
to
attack
iran
s
economic
lifeline
pentagon
officials
said
the
platform
had
been
used
as
a
base
for
iranian
raids
against
shipping
in
the
lower

we
have
chosen
a
military
target
but
we
also
have
shown
iran
that
we
are
willing
to
interfere
with
its
oil
exporting
capabilities
cordesman
said
he
predicted
the

would
respond
to
any

major

the

the

commissioners
that
any

for

had

that
the

from

payable
it

said
that
rtz
s

was

the
ruling
appeared
to
mean
that
tax
relief
on
the
expensive
process

would

the

the

the

the

by
however
the
rate
of
this
growth
can
be
affected
positively
or
negatively
through
government
action
or
inaction
lichtblau
said
he
said
that
one
of
the
government
s
negative
actions
is
the
maintenance
of
the
windfall
profits
tax
which
acts
as
a
disincentive
to
developing

and
reduces

lichtblau

the
adoption
of

an

floor
price
adopted
by
all

most

countries
would
clearly
be
a
much
more

measure

john
lichtblau
director

said
that
renegotiation
of

was
more
of
a
formality
as
the
saudis
have
each

on
a
separate
schedule
although
separate
agreements
with
the
companies
would
favor
one

negotiations
and
ensure
that

occur
the

will
probably
follow
the

wants
within

as
they
do
not
want
to
antagonize

the

suharto

apart
from
that
the

will
keep
improving
the

climate
in
order
to
accelerate
the
development
of
the
petroleum
industry
he
said
indonesian
energy
minister
subroto
told
the
association
he
was
aware
that
the
oil
industry
needed
to
be
assured
that
contracts
on
blocks
expiring
within
the
next
years
would
be
renewed
before
they
would
invest
in
further
exploration
as
we
all
have
heard
this
morning
the
president
is
fully
aware
of
this
situation
subroto
said
the
government
has
already
made
the
political
decision
to
entertain
this

problem

inviting
the

to
continue
their
activities

was
also
working

other
problems
including
granting
easier

for
remote

or
deep
water
conditions
but
subroto
said
relations
with
oil
companies
were
two
way
and
that
they
should
step
up
expenditure
on
oil
exploration
now
that
the

price
had
recovered

said
he
wanted
to
see

sharing

joint
operation
contracts
with

subroto
said
speeding
up
necessary
approvals
for
field
operations
was
a
government
priority
there
had
been
misunderstandings
between
the
government
and
the
oil
industry
in
certain
areas
such
as
when
a
field
is
designated
commercial
and
a
thorough
evaluation
was
being
made
he
said
the
government
wanted
to
finalise
contract
extensions
as
soon
as
practical
and
urged
the
industry
in
the
meantime
to
maintain
its
exploration
drive
subroto
said
indonesia
needed
the
companies
to
maintain
exploration
efforts
even
if
their
contract
was
due
to
expire
within
years
this
need
in
itself
is
some
sort
of
guarantee
that
we
will
soon
have

come
up

agreement

extension
of

has
involved
detailed
negotiations
but
so
far
no
extension
has
been
granted
subroto
told
reporters
afterwards
that
contract
extensions
would
be
selective
based
on
how

production
through

of

a

urged

he
said
geologic
condtions
in
the

were
favorable
for
the
discovery
of

fields
equal
to
those
in

the

equal

hodel
said
he
said
