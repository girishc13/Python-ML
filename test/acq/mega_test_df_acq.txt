the

that
although

attracted

to

the

acted
as

kicking

perhaps
throwing

the

you

the

private
analysts
said
entertainment
marketing
whose

quadrupled
in

be
looking
to
break
into
the
highly
competitive
new

city
retail
market
for

electronics
the
nation
s
biggest
at
a
time
the
fortunes
of

have
sagged
the

questioned
whether
houston

entertainment
marketing
founded
by
a
former
electronics
retailer
but
whose
present
buinesses
are
primarily
as
wholesale
distributors
had
the
management
expertise
for
retailing
or
was
merely
trying
to
drive
up
the
price
of
the

said
analyst

of

a

on
the
one
hand
it
s
probably
a
cheap
price
on
the
other
hand
does
entertainment

have
the
management
talent
to
run
it
and
will
the
crazy

leave
it

a
risky
strategy
for

electronics

is
very
management

want

laurence
said
that
since
entertainment
marketing
already
owns
percent
of

it

be
trying

signals

that
an

exists

dome
announced
its

to

as
well
as
public

in

after
several
months
of
delicate

transcanada

restructuring
oil
analyst
doug
gowland
of
brown

said
from

calgary

dome
s
restructuring
plan
would
allow
creditors
to
convert
debt
to
common
shares
under
a
formula
yet
to
be
negotiated
payments
on
remaining
debt
would
be
linked
to
cash
flow
generated
by
assets
pledged
against
the
debt
the
weakness
of
the
whole
debt
refinancing
proposal
is
that
even
with
approval
of
creditors
there
is
no
assurance
that
dome
will
in
fact
be
able
to
repay
all
of
its
debt
obligations
said
wilf
gobert
an
oil
analyst
for
peters
and
co

in
calgary
transcanada
s
announcement
came
as
a
surprise
since
dome
was
waiting
for
responses
from
creditors
on
its
proposed
refinancing
packages
gobert
said
the
transcanada
proposal
could
open
the
bidding
for
dome
since
other
potential
buyers
were
probably
waiting
for
lenders
to
agree
to
a
restructuring
he
added
i
would
think
that
the
debtholders
would
want
to
entertain
any
and
all
offers
for
dome
gobert
said
dome
spokesman
david
annesley
said
in
new
york
that
transcanada
s
announcement
could
be
seen
as
an
attempt
to
fix
the
bidding
price
for
dome
and
an
effort
to
preclude
other
possible
buyers
from
making
an
offer
by
drawing
attention
to
us
in
our
discussions
it
means
that
others
may
be
a
little
reluctant
to
come
forward
he
said
dome
does
not
consider
transcanada
s
proposal
a
formal
offer
because
the
pipeline
utility
s
announcement
breached
a
confidential
agreement
between
the
two
companies
he
said
dome
responded
to
the
statement
by
suspending
discussions
with
transcanada
in
order
to
pursue
talks
with
other
unidentified
parties
however
dome
said
its
management
and
financial
advisers
would
evaluate

painewebber
and
ammeen
met
with
edelman
and
dominion
in
november
and
continued
to
meet
with
them
until
a
couple
of
days
before
edelman
and
dominion
went
public
april
with
their
intention
to
take
over
the
company
burlington
lawyers
claim
dominion
s
board
decided
to
attempt
a
takeover
of
burlington
after
ammeen
met
with
the
board
in
february
burlington
lawyers
said
edelman
and
dominion
held
discussions
with
painewebber
and
ammeen
about
acting
as
financial
advisers
to
samjens
but
they
allege
talks
broke
off
because
painewebber
and
ammeen
could
not
satisfy
edelman
and
dominion
with
a
written
statement
that
they
did
not
provide
inside
information
lawyers
for
samjens
contended
that
painewebber
and
ammeen
withdrew
as
potential
advisers
because
burlington
chairman
frank
greenberg
had
called
a
painewebber
executive
and
threatened
legal
action
if
painewebber
got
involved
in
an
effort
to
takeover
burlilgnton
the
ultimate
question
is
not
the
price
per
share
or
the
profit
but
rather
the
permissable
standards
of
conduct
for
those
who
would
takeover
an
american
company
said
burlington
lawyer
humphrey
burlington
lawyers
also
contended
that
burlington
as
the
largest
manufacturer
of
denim
in
the
united
states
would
be
in
violation
of
anti
trust
laws
if
it
acquired
dominion
canada
s
largest
textile
maker
dominion
has
denim
manufacturing
plants
in
georgia
which
would
reduce
competition
in
the
denim
market
the
lawyers
said
samjens
lawyers
discounted
the
concern
they
said
the
market
for
denim
is
more
fragmented
than
burlington
contends
and
that
burlington
has
the
ability
to
switch
between
light
weight
and
heavy
weight
denim
production
as
demand
and
price
dictate
samjens
lawyers
also
pointed
to
a
lawsuit
filed
by
burlington
in
canada
in
which
it
said
it
was
considering
a

for

said

council
a

of

said
that
a

of

in

found
that

that

said
the
study
grew
out
of
concern
that
mergers
and

had
seriously
hurt
the
economic
climate
of
northern
california
however
hall
said
that
only
about
jobs
had
been
lost
in
the
region
while
more
than
new
jobs
were
created
during
the
period
at
the

time
he
said
the

experienced
a
greater
rise
in

council
president
george

who
also
is

chief

officer
of

corp
told
a
news
conference
that
the
region
had
difficulties
in
persuading
companies
to
locate
there
because
of
a
fragmented
local
political
system
but
he
said
that
because
of
the
amenities
of
living
in
san

he
was
the
envy
of
many
chief
executives
in
other
metropolitan
area
it

a
great
place
to
run
a
business
he
added
but
it
s
a
hell
of
a
place
to
do
business
with

the
study
concluded
that
chevron
which
mergered
with
gulf
oil
in
would
benefit
in
the
long

from
the

the

due

the

this

typical
said
george

of

there
s
going

american

had
to
make
an

still
a

less

the

has
been
in
the
limelight
for
the
past
year
as
its
investigators
have
probed
into
the
most
colossal
insider
trading
scandal
ever
uncovered
on
wall
street
the
investigation
which
is
still
active
mushroomed
in
recent
months
as
a
growing
number
of
well
known
traders
and
prominent
investment
banking
firms
have
been
charged
with
wrongdoing
the
pace
of
the
probe
picked
up
markedly
in
november
after
ivan
boesky
one
of
wall
street

most
successful

speculators
agreed
to
cooperate
with

investigators
and
to
pay
a
record
mln
dlrs
in
penalties
and
illegal
profits
after
being
charged
with
insider
trading
but
the
agency
is
also
wrestling
with
a
vexing
new
phenomenon
of
huge
and
rapid
swings
in
stock
prices
spurred
by
computer
driven
trading
strategies
that
span
markets
in
securities
options
and
futures
the
price
gyrations
have
combined
with
rising
trading
volumes
to
bring
unprecedented
volatility
to
some
u
s
securities
markets
at
the
same
time
the
sec
is
being
pressed
by
some
lawmakers
to
put
a
stop
to
abusive
tactics
in
corporate
takeover
contests
as
an
unrelenting
wave
of
such
takeovers
steadily
reshapes
the
u
s
corporate
landscape
and
the
agency
is
being
pushed
by
u

and
foreign
exchanges
intent
on
expansion
to
lay
the
regulatory
groundwork
for
an
international
securities
marketplace
in
which
trading
occurs
across
borders
throughout
the
world
around
the
clock
such
worldwide
trading
networks
offer
vast
new
investment
opportunities
but
could
strain
the

to
enforce
u

laws
and
guard

shad
who
had

hutton

brought
a

street
perspective
to
the
agency
upon
being
named
chairman
in
in
line
with
the
views
of
other
top
administration
officials
he
favored
marketplace
determination
of
takeover
battles
over
new
federal
regulations
the

under

also
stressed
prosecution
of

securities
lawyers
and
industry
officials
acquainted

ruder
say
the
new

is
unlikely
to
significantly
alter
the
commission
s
current
priorities
the
sec
currently
has
about
employees
most
of
them
lawyers
and
an
annual
budget
of
about
mln
dlrs
though
that
figure
likely
will
be
significantly
higher
next
year
as
the
agency
moves
to
beef
up
its
enforcement
staff
the
agency
is
one
of
the
few
in
the
government
that
actually
has
taken
in
more
money
than
it
has
spent
in
the
past
few
years
because
of
fees
it
charges
public
companies
investment
banks
and
other
securities
firms
it

the
sec

structured
as
an
independent
regulatory
agency
meaning
that
its
five
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
president
to
fixed
five
year
terms
and
protected
from
firing
for
policy
differences
alone
by
law
no
more
than
three
commissioners
may
be
of
the
same
political
party
and
the
agency
prepares
its
own
budget
request
each
year
instead
of
leaving
this

the

traces
its
origins
to
the

crash
of
which
was
attributed
in
large
part
to
widespread
trading
on

and
attempted
market
manipulations
by
large
investment
firms
the
agency
requires
public

to
issue
periodic
reports
on
their
financial
condition
and
to
disclose

this

announced
in

an
agreement
in
principle
to
form
a
joint
venture
to
develop
new
biotechnology
products
in
several
fields
as
part
of
the
deal
squibb
will
license
several
of

anticancer
agents

squibb
will
sell
the
drugs
only
in

but
not
in

and
western

we
wouldn
t
have
done
this
deal
had
it
not
been
understood
that
cetus
wants
to
build
its
own
fully
integrated
business
in
north
america
and
europe
said
fildes
he
said
squibb
was
the
good
partner
because
squibb
has
a
major
joint
venture
in
japan
and
has
sales
capabilities
of
its
own
in
that
market
fildes
said
cetus
has
shunned
licensing
arrangements
with
pharmaceutical
companies
because
it
wanted
to
build
its
own
business
many
large
corporations
have
invested
in
small
biotech
firms
but
squibb
s
investment
in
cetus
is
the
first
it
has
made
in
biotechnology
fildes
said
that
was
attractive
to
cetus
because
it
wanted
a
partner
that
didn
t
have
a
relationship
with
a
large
number
of
other
biotechnology
companies
fildes
said
his
strategy
was
to
have
partners
in
non
drug
areas
like
diagnostics
and
agriculture
but
to
keep
the
biggest
developments
in
anticancer
drugs
to
ourselves
fildes
said
the
partnership
with
squibb
would
be
used
to
broaden
the
company
s
reach
in
such
big
money
making
areas
as
the
cardiovascular
anti
infective
and
the
anti
inflammatory
markets

csr
executive
director

told

etl
said
today
it
would
offer
dlrs
each
for
monier
s
issued
capital
of
mln
shares
plus
a
share
alternative
this
compares
with
a
dlr
cash
element
in

proposed

the
proposed
offer
by
etl
controlled
by
new

hawkins
came
after
it
built
up
a
pct
stake
in
monier
in
a

raid
in

herbert
said
britain
s
redland

rdld
l
which
holds
just
under
pct
of
monier
still
supported
the
csr
bid
and
had
told
csr
it
is
not
a
seller
he
said
redland
wanted
to
maintain
and
build
on
its
operations
in
australia
and
the
u
s
where
monier
has
built
up
a
strong
presence
notably
in
roofing
tile
manufacture
the
csr
offer
contains
a
put
and
call
option
agreement
with
redland
this
enables
redland
to
accept
the
csr
bid
within
six
months
of
its
close
or
to
lift
its
stake
to
pct
in
the
same
period
and
to
run
monier
as
a
joint
venture
with
csr
csr
has
said
that
redland
will
take
up
the
second
option
etl
has
declined
to
say
why
it
intervened
in
monier
beyond
describing
it
as
a
long
term
investment
etl
would
bring
no
synergies
to
monier
unlike
csr
which
is
a
leader
in
building
materials
herbert
said
we
fit
better
with
monier
he
said
csr
has
said
that
it
will
concentrate
development
on
its
core
businesses
of
sugar
and
building
materials
after
its
moves
into
energy
several
years

asked
what
he
thought
etl
s
bid
sought
to
achieve
herbert
said
i
m
puzzled
as
to
what
hawkins
strategy
is
one
has
to
wonder
if
monier
is
the
main
target
herbert
said
csr
had
no
plans
to
raise
its
bid
and
said
a
higher
price
would
be
difficult
to
justify
on
fundamentals
monier
was

herbert
also
said
that
institutions
which
are
more
likely
to
accept
a
share
alternative
than
cash
would
have
to
judge
the
respective
values
of
etl
and
csr
shares
etl
is
the
third
group
to
become
involved
in
a
possible
acquisition
of
monier
this

redland
held
discussions
on
a
possible
takeover
before
the
csr
bid
emerged
but
the
negotiations
foundered
on
the
price
share
analysts
said
that
for
this
reason
they
did
not
think
etl

intervention
would
flush
out
a

monier

sosnoff
said
in
the

that
the
amended

is
conditioned
on
receipt
of
enough

to
give
him
a
majority
interest
on
a
fully
diluted
basis
and
on
the
arrangement
of
financing
as
well
as
to
approvals
by
new

nevada
gaming
authorities
he
said
the
tender
would
be
the
first
step
in
acquiring
all

and
if
successful
would
be
followed
by
a

sosnoff
said
later
in

that
the

the

can
you
buy

heyman

he
s
a

he

pushed

they

even
if

a

ronald

rev
may
be
trying
to
ignite
a
bidding
war
for
gillette
co
that
could
draw
some
big
international
players
and
in
the
process
make
a
lot
of
money
for
himself
wall
street
analysts
said
several
hours
before
a
regularly
scheduled
board
of
directors
meeting
gillette
disclosed
that
perelman
requested
consent
of
its
board
for
an
offer
of
at
least
dlrs
per
share
perelman
needed
the
consent
because
he
agreed
in
november
not
to
buy
stock
for
years
without
permission
i
think
ronald
perelman
is
less
interested
in
gillette
and
more
interested
in
putting
gillette
into
play
because
he
stands
to
make
a

of
money

andrew
shore
analyst
at

in
play
is
a
term
used
on

street
to
describe
what
happens
when
a
company
becomes
an
unwiling
takeover
target
shore
noted
that
according
to
the
agreement
revlon
gets
paid
if
there
is
any
acquisition
of
gillette
through
november
of
this
year
at
a
price
higher
than
dlrs
per
share
gillette
rose
three
to
today
following
a
gain
of
three
yesterday
the
agreement
would
be
calculated
on
the
basis
of
perelman
s
previous
holding
of
mln
shares
adjusted
for
a
split
for
example
a
deal
between
gillette
and
some
other
company
at
dlrs
per
share
would
make
revlon
richer
by
mln
dlrs
under
the
formula
neither
perelman
nor
his
spokesmen
returned
telephone
calls
seeking
comment
revlon
stands
to
make
a
substantial
amount
of
money
if
someone
else
takes
over
gillette
said
analyst
deepak
raj
of
merrill
lynch
and
co
i
m
not
saying
that
is
going
to
happen
but
gillette
is
an
undervalued
stock
with
a
breakup
value
of
dlrs
per
share
shore
of
shearson
lehman
said
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
perelman
may
not
be
really
interested
in
acquiring
gillette
he
said
perelman
in
the
process
of
taking
revlon
private
after
acquiring
control
of
the
cosmetics
company
two
years
ago
probably
wants
to
concentrate
on
improving
revlon
s
operations
he
s
trying
to
overhaul
and
improve
the
image
of
the
dearptment
store
business
another
reason
is
that
revlon
has
recently
made
two
other
acquisitions
under
those
circumstances
shore
would
not
be
surprised
if
some
company
such
as
unilever
plc
un
as
or
procter
and
gamble
co
pg
decided
to
take
a

he

the

to

gobert
characterized
the

said
the

looking

the

offer
has
quite
a

he
said

said
he
believes
the

is
at

which
it
took
on
several
years

when

there
has
been
speculation
that
dome
s
assets
are
capable
of
supporting
debt
of
three
to
four

so
on
that
basis
the

offer
would
be
at
the
upper

they

looks

unlikely

if

they
won

another

the

also
doubted
that

could
afford
to
retain
its
original
offer
however
industry
sources
were
more
uncertain
about

for
the

price
so
low

of
irving
s

to

which

drop
from

increases
the

flores
said
analysts
said
that
the
drop
in

stock
prices
is
likely
to
depress
the
level
of
mergers
and
acquisition
in
the
banking
industry
bank
takeovers
are
less
likely
because
banks
can
t
use
their
own
stock
to
make
acquisitions
because
their
share
price
is
too
depressed
alpert
said
since
only

can
buy
another

the
only
other
possible
acquirors
would

he
said
rumors

it

the

had
operating
earnings
of

last

he
expected
it
to
earn
about
mln
dlrs
this
year
based
on
a
multiple
of

earnings
which
pzena
says
chemical

now

worth
about
three
billion
dlrs
putting
the
pct

at
around
to
mln

pzena
said
he
thought
the
company
was
selling
the
stake
because
chemical
margins
had
peaked
and
he
speculated
the

would
use
the
proceeds
to
pay
down

he
added
the
possibility
remained
the

would
fall
through

proxmire
outlines
insider
trading
legislation
washington
april
senate
banking
committee
chairman
william
proxmire
d
wis
said
he
planned
to
introduce
legislation
shortly
to
require
greater
public
disclosure
of
corporate
takeovers
and
fairer
treatment
for
all
shareholders
speaking
to
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
proxmire
said
recent
insider
trading
stock
scandals
increased
the
chance
that
congress
will
act
to
curb
abuses
we
are
proposing
legislation
that
would
provide
for
more
disclosure
would
be
fairer
to
all
shareholders
and
would
insure
that
takeovers
are
properly
financed
he
said
among
the
provisions
the
bill
would
reduce
the
threshold
for
notifying
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
that
a
investor
or
group
has
acquired
a
percentage
of
stock
in
a
company
to
three
pct
from
the
current
five
pct
threshold
within
days
proxmire
said
in
addition
there
would
be
a
pre
notificaton
requirement
that
an
investor
intended
to
aquire
three
pct
that
would
have
to
filed
with
the
sec
proxmire
said
the
pre
notification
requirement
was
meant
to
prevent
arbitragers
from
having
a
jump
on
the
general
public
in
knowing
about
coming
takeover
attempts
proxmire
said
he
would
call
for
extending
the
period
that
a
tender
offer
must
be
kept
open
under
the
williams
act
to
business
days
from
the
current
business
days
his
bill
would
provide
for
private
suits
if
the
acquiring
company
violated
the
time
period
on
the
tender
offer
to
correct
abuses
in
the
financing
of
takeovers
proxmire
said
the
legislation
would
aim
at
insuring
current
margin
requirments
are
properly
enforced
the
federal
reserve
board
has
a
pct
margin
requirement
for
purchasing
stock
but
proxmire
said
it
is
not
generally
enforced
in
hostile
takeovers
rather
the
groups
or
individuals
leading
a
takeover
declare
that
they
can
raise
the
capital
for
a
takeover
without
actually
putting
any
of
their
own
money
proxmire
said
he
said
his
bill
would
allow
private
suits
for
damages
for
failure
to
meet
the
federal
reserve
s
pct
margin
requirements
the
bill
also
would
require
more
disclose
when
several
investors
form
an
alliance
in
a
hostile
takeover
when
pickens
and
icahn
get
together
we
want
people
to
know
about
it
proxmire
said
proxmire
said
he
favored
the
approach
used
in
britain
towards
two
tiered
tender
offers
that
insures
that
all
shareholders
recieve
equal
treatment
he
said
he
expected
amendments
to
the
bill
also
would
cover
defensive
mechanisms
such
as
green
mail
and
poison
pills
proxmire
said
he
intended
to
introduce
his
bill
later
this
month
and
predicted
the
senate
committee
would
act

sumitomo

aims
at

from
merger
tokyo

sumitomo
bank
ltd
sumi
t
is
certain
to
lose
its
status
as
japan
s
most
profitable
bank
as
a
result
of
its
merger
with
the
heiwa
sogo
bank
financial
analysts
said
osaka
based
sumitomo
with
desposits
of
around
trillion
yen
merged
with
heiwa
sogo
a
small
struggling
bank
with
an
estimated
billion
dlrs
in
unrecoverable
loans
in
october
but
despite
the
link
up
sumitomo
president
koh
komatsu
told
reuters
he
is
confident
his
bank
can
quickly
regain
its
position
we
ll
be
back
in
position
in
first
place
within
three
years
komatsu
said
in
an
interview
he
said
that
while
the
merger
will
initially
reduce
sumitomo
s
profitability
and
efficiency
it
will
vastly
expand
sumitomo
s
branch
network
in
the
tokyo
metropolitan
area
where
it
has
been
relatively
weak
but
financial
analysts
are
divided
on
whether
and
how
quickly
the
gamble
will
pay
off
some
said
sumitomo
may
have
paid
too
much
for
heiwa
sogo
in
view
of
the
smaller
bank
s
large
debts
others
argue
the
merger
was
more
cost
effective
than
creating
a
comparable
branch
network
from
scratch
the
analysts
agreed
the
bank
was
aggressive
it
has
expanded
overseas
entered
the
lucrative
securities
business
and
geared
up
for
domestic
competition
but
they
questioned
the
wisdom
of
some
of
those
moves
they
ve
made
bold
moves
to
put
everything
in
place
now
it
s
largely
out
of
their
hands
said
kleinwort
benson
ltd
financial
analyst
simon
smithson
among
sumitomo
s
problems
are
limits
placed
on
its
move
to
enter
u
s
securities
business
by
taking
a
share
in
american
investment
bank
goldman
sachs
and
co
sumitomo
last
august
agreed
to
pay
mln
dlrs
for
a
pct
limited
partnership
in
the
bank
but
for
the
time
being
at
least
the
federal
reserve
board
has
forbidden
them
to
exchange
personnel
or
increase
the
business
they
do
with
each
other
the
tie
up
is
widely
looked
on
as
a
lame
duck
because
the
fed
was
stricter
than
sumitomo
expected
said
one
analyst
but
komatsu
said
the
move
will
pay
off
in
time
u
s
regulations
will
change
in
the
near
future
and
if
so
we
can
do
various
things
we
only
have
to
wait
two
or
three
years
not
until
the
century
komatsu
said
komatsu
is
also
willing
to
be
patient
about
possible
routes
into
the
securities
business
at

japan

s
glass
steagall
act
separates
commercial
from
investment
banking
but
the
walls
between
the
two
are
crumbling
and
komatsu
said
he
hopes
further
deregulation
will
create
new
opportunities
we
need
to
find
new
business
chances
komatsu
said
in
some
cases
these
will
be
securities
related
in
some
cases
trust
bank
related
that
s
the
kind
of
deregulation
we
want
until
such
changes
occur
sumitomo
will
focus
on
such
domestic
securities
business
as
profitable
government
bond
dealing
and
strengthening
relations
with
meiko
securities
co
ltd
in
which
it
holds
a
five
pct
share
komatsu
said
he
said
sumitomo
is
cautiously
optimistic
about
entering
the
securities
business
here
through
its
swiss
universal
bank
subsidiary
banca
del
gottardo
the
finance
ministry
is
expected
to
grant
licences
to
securities
subsidiaries
of
u
s
commercial
banks
soon
following
a
similar
decision
for
subsidiaries
of
european
universal
banks
in
which
the
parent
holds
a
less
than
pct
but
komatsu
is
reluctant
to
push
hard
for
a
similar
decision
on
a
gottardo
subsidiary
we
don
t
want
to
make
waves
we
expect
this
will
be
allowed
in
two
or
three
years
he
said
like
other
city
banks
sumitomo
is
also
pushing
to
expand
lending
to
individuals
and
small
and
medium
businesses
to
replace
disappearing
demand
from
big
business
he
added
the
analysts
said
sumitomo
will
have
to
devote
a
lot
of
time
to
digesting
its
most
recent
initiatives
including
the
merger
with
ailing
heiwa
sogo
it
s
sumitomo
been
bold
in
its
strategies
said
kleinwort
s
smithson
after
that
it
s
a
question
of
absorbing
and
juggling
around
it
will
be
the
next

before
we
see
if
the
strategy
is
right

not
done

he

as
a

analysts

is

get
approval
for
a
plan
to
refinance
debt
of
more
than
billion
dlrs
by
july
when
an
interim
debt
plan
that
allowed
the
canadian
oil
and

firm
to
defer
substantial
payments

will
expire
analysts
said
transcanada
s
bid
signals
dome
s
debtholders
that
an
alternative
exists
to
dome
s
debt
plan
dome
announced
its
plan
to
major
creditors
as
well
as
public
noteholders
in
march
after
several
months
of
delicate
negotiations
transcanada
s
proposal
amounts
to
a
quasi
debt
restructuring
oil
analyst
doug
gowland
of
brown
baldwin
nisker
ltd
said
from
toronto
calgary
based
dome
s
restructuring
plan
would
allow
creditors
to
convert
debt
to
common
shares
under
a
formula
yet
to
be
negotiated
payments
on
remaining
debt
would
be
linked
to
cash
flow
generated
by
assets
pledged
against
the
debt
the
weakness
of
the
whole
debt
refinancing
proposal
is
that
even
with
approval
of
creditors
there
is
no
assurance
that
dome
will
in
fact
be
able
to
repay
all
of
its
debt
obligations
said
wilf
gobert
an
oil
analyst
for
peters
and
co
ltd
in
calgary
transcanada
s
announcement
came
as
a
surprise
since
dome
was
waiting
for
responses
from
creditors
on
its
proposed
refinancing
packages
gobert
said
the
transcanada
proposal
could
open
the
bidding
for
dome
since
other
potential
buyers
were
probably
waiting
for
lenders
to
agree
to
a
restructuring
he
added
i
would
think
that
the
debtholders
would
want
to
entertain
any
and
all
offers
for
dome
gobert
said
dome
spokesman
david
annesley
said
in
new
york
that
transcanada
s
announcement
could
be
seen
as
an
attempt
to
fix
the
bidding
price
for
dome
and
an
effort
to
preclude
other
possible
buyers
from
making
an
offer
by
drawing
attention
to
us
in
our
discussions
it
means
that
others
may
be
a
little
reluctant
to
come
forward
he
said
dome
does
not
consider
transcanada
s
proposal
a
formal
offer
because
the
pipeline
utility
s
announcement
breached
a
confidential
agreement
between
the
two
companies
he
said
dome
responded
to
the
statement
by
suspending
discussions
with
transcanada
in
order
to
pursue
talks
with
other
unidentified
parties
however
dome
said
its
management
and
financial
advisers
would
evaluate
all
proposals
including
transcanada
s
gowland
said
transcanada
s
offer
is
probably
a
fair
price
for
the
company
s
mln
acres
of
oil
and
gas
land
holdings
however
he
said
not
enough
financial
details
are
known
about
dome
s
debt
restructuring
to
compare
the
value
of
transcanada
s
proposed
offer
