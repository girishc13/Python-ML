STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings
of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the
Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told
journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22
agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange
rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what
measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of
Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl
Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as
the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is
greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at
the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its
major trading partners. "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris
accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but
I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre
agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against
the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to
support the dollar. "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the
market," he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of
the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that
Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. "And
we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they
promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through
Congress," he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about
a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct
against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. "You
cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a
German problem, it is a European problem," he said.

STOLTENBERG ASSUMES COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
The West German government assumes that the commitment to
international monetary cooperation which was renewed in Washington
last month will continue, a Finance Ministry spokesman quoted Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg as saying. Stoltenberg's statement was a
reaction to criticism of rises in West German interest rates voiced by
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker over the weekend.

BONN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON BAKER REMARKS
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
The West German Finance Ministry declined to comment on weekend
criticism by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker of recent West German
interest rate increases. Baker said the U.S. Would re-examine the
February Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading
industrial democracies. The rise in West Germany short term interest
rates was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in
Washington, which reaffirmed the Louvre pact, he said. A Finance
Ministry spokesman, asked for an official ministry reaction to Baker's
remarks, said he could make no comment.

STOLTENBERG DOES NOT RULE OUT INTERVENTION
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he could not
rule out the possibility of central bank intervention to support
currencies. Asked at a news conference whether central banks were
prepared to intervene to defend currencies, he said "We cannot rule
out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign currency
stability." However, he added that in the end, it was market forces
which prevailed.

REAGAN SAYS U.S., ALLIES MUST HONOR ACCORDS ON EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY




STOLTENBERG SAYS BAKER MEETING UNDERSCORES ACCORD
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the meeting on
Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker underscored the
determination of the U.S. And West Germany to continue close
cooperation to stabilise foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told a
news conference "The statement released yesterday (Monday) after the
private meeting .... Emphasized our determination to continue the
close economic cooperation regarding foreign exchange stabilization
and monetary policy." Stoltenberg said that he, Baker and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had
all reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their
meeting on Monday. Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several
European counterparts showed that they shared this view. "We expect
the declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect," he
said. He noted that the dollar firmed again in late U.S. Trading after
the outcome of the Baker meeting was published.

KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN
    KUWAIT, June 2 - 
Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits held firm in scattered
trading despite a Central Bank decision to revive limited funding
lines, dealers said. The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily
aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the
facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they
said. It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities,
dealers said. Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of
dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising
from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said.
However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still unsettled."
Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to
30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the
close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct,
ended at 14, eight. Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after
opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an
early 9-1/2, 7-1/2. One month rates were at the same level after trade
at eight then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct
and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one
year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close. The Central Bank fixed its dinar
exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's
0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

FED'S JOHNSON SAYS LOUVRE ACCORD STILL VITAL
    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - 
Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the Louvre
Accord is still healthy, but said the United States and West Germany
must work out differences over their respective roles in fulfilling
the accord. "The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of
stabilizing exchange rates," he said in response to a question during
an American Stock Exchange conference here. He said exchange rates
have been stable so far in 1987 as a result of the accord.

JAPAN'S LDP TO CALL FOR FLEXIBLE MONETARY POLICIES
    TOKYO, April 17 - 
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will call for adequate
and flexible management of the nation's monetary polices in its plan
to expand domestic demand, a senior LDP official told Reuters.
Junichiro Koizumi, the head of the LDP committee working out the plan,
said the phrase should not be taken as implying an immediate cut in
Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. "The LDP generally believes that there
is no need for a further discount rate cut at the moment," he said.
But Koizumi said the LDP does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in
the future. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a press
conference on Wednesday that the central bank does not have any
intention of easing credit conditions.

SUMITA WELCOMES U.S.-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON LOUVRE
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's U.S.
And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre
accord. Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were
excessively concerned about the economic future. The Bank of Japan
will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon
the Louvre accord of February, he said. The accord called for
stability in foreign exchange rates. Exchange rates generally are
regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are
heading for a steady recovery, he said.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 68 MLN STG HELP
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it provided the market with a further 68 mln
stg assistance this afternoon, bringing its total assistance on the
day to 143 mln stg. Shortly before, the Bank said it had revised its
estimate of the shortage up to 450 mln stg from the earlier forecast
of 400 mln. During the afternoon, the bank bought 22 mln stg of band
two bank bills at 9-13/16 pct and two mln stg of local authority bills
plus 44 mln stg of bank bills in band four at 9-11/16 pct. These rates
were in all cases unchanged from previous intervention levels.

BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the
continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency
stability by all major industrial countries. Balladur, responding to
weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the U.S.
Would take another look at the accords, said "I firmly desire a
faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to
the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." On Sunday,
Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates
was not in keeping with the accords. The Louvre accords, agreed in
Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies
after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the
Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker
said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was "not in keeping
with the spirit of what we agreed to." "What I'm really saying is that
they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased
tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going
to follow them," he added.

WEST GERMANY STILL COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
West German government sources said Bonn remained committed to the
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies, which was struck by leading
western democracies in Paris last February. Over the weekend, U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker criticised recent rises in West German
short-term interest rates and said such developments were not in the
spirit of the Louvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-
examined. The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to
be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide.

LAWSON SEES NO CHANGE IN U.K. MONETARY POLICY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he saw no
immediate implications for British monetary policy arising from the
Group of Seven meeting yesterday. "Exchange rate stability is in the
U.K.'s interest," he told journalists. Asked what it meant for U.K.
monetary policy, he said, "No, I do not think there are any immediate
implications."

REAGAN URGES FULFILLMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCORDS
    WASHINGTON, June 1 - 
President Reagan, preparing to depart for the Venice economic summit
on Wednesday, said the United States and its allies must fulfill
agreements on exchange rate stability. "Economic policy decisions made
last year in Tokyo, and at this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance
ministers in Paris and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten,"
he said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated
into action," Reagan said in a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th
anniversary of the Marshall Plan.

Stoltenberg declines comment on possible changed targets for currencies




FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY
    WASHINGTON, June 18 - 
Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger said there were signs of
helpful stability in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks. "I
think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets," Seger told
reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
"I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period of
stability," she said. She said market forces have a major influence on
exchange rates and said she did not know the right value for the
dollar against the Yen or the Mark. Seger told the Savings and Loan
executives that she was concerned about financial markets' absorption
with exchange rate influences. "I am concerned that we have gotten so
nervous," about exchange rates, Seger said. She said the Fed takes
into account additional factors in determining monetary policy than
the value of the dollar against other currencies. On the economy,
Seger called the latest figures in gross national product a modest
upward revision.

DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF SAYS LOUVRE PACT STILL INTACT
    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - 
Deutsche Bank AG joint chief executive Friedrich Wilhelm Christians
said he believed the Louvre accord on currency stability was still
intact. Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term German
interest rates had risen twice. "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the
dollar is still within the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the
accord has been terminated," Christians said. He was responding to
questions about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was
still operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.

G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT
    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - 
International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep
cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability
to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital
markets, economists and currency traders said. "I don't think the
Louvre is dead because if it breaks up in an acrimonious way, the
potential outcome is a rout of the dollar, higher interest rates and
collapsing stock markets. It's in the Group of Seven's interest to
calm things down," said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at
BankAmerica Corp. In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury
secretary James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to foster
exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed. His comments rocked the
currency markets and helped send the already-fragile U.S. and overseas
stock markets into a tailspin. The dollar lost more than two pfennigs
in the U.S. to about 1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35
yen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at
one stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS
    TOKYO, April 13 - 
The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in deficit financing bills
today through 51-day repurchase agreements maturing June 3 to help
absorb a projected money market surplus, money traders said. The
operation will raise the outstanding supply of the bills to a record
4,800 billion yen. The yield on the bills for sale to banks and
securities houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with
the two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and
the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct. The traders
estimated the surplus today at about 1,800 billion yen. They said it
is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of government tax allocations to
local governments and public entities and to excessive banking system
cash holdings due to continuous large central bank dollar purchases.

BANKS EXTEND TRADING HALT IN LEBANESE POUND
    BEIRUT, Oct 19 - 
Lebanon's Bankers Association said it extended its suspension of
trading in the Lebanese pound for two more working days to study ways
to stem the currency's collapse. The Central Bank did not post the
rate of the pound to the dollar and other currencies on Monday. The
pound closed on Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00. Association sources told Reuters
Friday's suspension of trading for two working days was continued on
Monday for two more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the
pound. The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in east
and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic market after
the pound crashed to four record lows in the week. The pound, hit by
the inability of Lebanon's religiously and ideologically divided
government to end 12 years of civil war, has lost more than 80 pct of
its international value this year.

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system
has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and
preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks
before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's
Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system
should be abandoned. "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need
something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right
direction when the wind shifts." He said that indicators can serve "as
a kind of compass" but added that structural indicators can help focus
attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to
move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators
that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today." The Treasury Secretary
said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the
annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund
performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for
the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more
relevant to national policymakers and the public. "In particular, we
urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV
consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to
implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device
"for moving beyond rhetoric to action." He said they provide "more
structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure
into the process of policy coordination." He said the Fund's
procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect
the use of indicators. "This should be matter of priority for the
executive board," he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop
alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can
help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications
of these options." He said also that further work should be done on
finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. "If we
are to take effective remedial action when there are significant
deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive
ways of indentifying the right course for key variables," he said.

DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - 
European Community Commission President Jacques Delors called for a
swift convening of a meeting of the G-7 countries following the
instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets. He
told a press conference here: "G-7 should meet discreetly and
quickly." Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would undergo
a "test by fire." Delors said the current problems in the markets had
been caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy
to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances. He said
it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent increases in West
Germany.

GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR SPECIAL MONETARY MEETING
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
Finance ministers from major industrial nations should hold a special
meeting to deal with the U.S. Dollar's sharp decline, Helmut Geiger,
president of the West German savings bank association, said. Geiger
told Reuters: "Finance ministers should meet soon to take confidence-
building measures to limit the damage caused by the dollar's fall."
Separately, Geiger told Bild newspaper in an interview released ahead
of publication on Tuesday that the lower dollar, which had been
artificially talked down by U.S. officials, would damage West German
exports and cost jobs.

LAWSON SAYS U.S.-WEST GERMAN ROW WAS UNNECESSARY
    LONDON, Oct 20 - 
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the recent dispute
between the United States and West Germany over economic policy was
responsible for much financial turmoil and that it should never have
happened. He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned
fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important between
finance ministers of the major nations. He said the dispute was a row
which should not have happened and agreed that much of the blame lay
with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised
West Germany for having raised its key interest rates.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN LATE HELP OF 210 MLN STG
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it gave the market late assistance of around
210 mln stg, bringing its total help on the day to some 353 mln stg.
This compares with the Bank's estimate of the liquidity shortage of
around 450 mln stg, raised from its early forecast of 400 mln stg.

 Balladur urges G-7 to respect pledges on monetary policy in Louvre accord




BONN CONFIDENT OF MAINTAINING CURRENCY STABILITY
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in
Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman said. After the
meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident
that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels.
The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing
short-term money market interest rates. He had said the rise was not
in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the
U.S. dollar last February. The meeting had been arranged last week,
the spokesman said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue
the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency
stability and monetary policy. Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak
injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which
money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German
monetary authority to curb interest rate rises. The spokesman
described Monday's talks, which he called private, as very positive.

NEW ZEALAND WILL CONTINUE FIRM MONETARY POLICY
    WELLINGTON, Oct 20 - 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said there was no evidence to suggest
the fall in share prices had affected financial stability and it would
maintain its firm monetary policy. Governor Spencer Russell said in a
statement the central bank did not accept arguments that the battle
against inflation should now take a low second priority after the
sharemarket's plunge. Russell said the bank had two statutory
responsibilities -- to implement the government's monetary policy to
bring down inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.
"Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary policy will
continue because it is very much in the national interest that it do
so," he said. "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to
suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the stability of
the financial sector." The Barclays share index fell a record 504.75
points to 2,925,26 on Tuesday, a decline of 14.7 pct.

POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK
    FRANKFURT, June 2 - 
For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators,
for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the
world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he
is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent
West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of
this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights,
see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl
spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social
Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There
has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace
Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials
noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in
1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of
the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it
would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances,
Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former
Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut
Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt
who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In
recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl
has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's
council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued
monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans
can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with
consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so
far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a
little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a
bloated exchange rate. "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise
the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would
endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business journalists in
Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says
that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so
rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy," she
said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified,
said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus
for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards
money supply." One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the
United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The
Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said
they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been
relatively stable since the pact. "This is because the markets know -
or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,"
Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn
rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born
in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before
starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who
enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype
central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch
football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot
substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are
imbalanced. "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small
amount if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of many
people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the
Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an
uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in
serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German
interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as
the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets
plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the
dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West
Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he
attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. "That's
not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as
earlier this month in Washington," Baker said in a U.S. Television
interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance
Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations
which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and
Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their
economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on
Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West
German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the
accord. "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's
going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in
terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-
Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a
much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is
apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the
Baker comment will regret it later on." French Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of
the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He
called for "a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial
countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury
commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said
that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord." In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief
executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was
still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted
as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-
term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday,
down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term
liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French
money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at
7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct.

FED EXPECTED TO SET THREE-DAY REPURCHASE PACTS
    NEW YORK, April 13 - 
The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government
securities market to add temporary reserves directly by arranging
three-day System repurchase agreements, economists said. They said the
Fed may add the reserves indirectly instead via a large round, two
billion dlrs or more, of customer repurchase agreements. Federal
funds, which averaged a high 6.35 pct on Friday, opened at 6-7/16 pct
and traded between there and 6-1/2 pct.

Miyazawa says Baker's remarks were aimed at just reaffirming Louvre agreement




LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL
    LONDON, June 2 - 
The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has
carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to
stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven
industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was "content" with sterling's
current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted "to maintain the
exchange rate stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say
if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May
currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise,
pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a
hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We
have been playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our
commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. "We
wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added. Asked which
techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both
central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to
tackle "the market pressures there are from time to time." "Interest
rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be
moved up and down at times," he added. Lawson said he expected
intervention to be "sterilised" by draining excess sterling liquidity
from the market through new issues of government securities and
foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the
inflationary impact of intervention, he said. "Sterilisation will be
dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which
intervention occurs," Lawson said. "I am confident that we can
sterilise on this scale."

BAKER REMARKS AIMED AT CONFIRMING ACCORD-MIYAZAWA
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that remarks by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker on Sunday that some nations were not
abiding by the spirit of the Louvre Accord were just aimed at
reaffirming that agreement. The agreement, to cooperate in stabilising
currencies, was reached in Paris in February this year. The finance
minister made the remark at a news conference which followed a morning
cabinet meeting.

LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS
    LONDON, Oct 20 - 
U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord
cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy
which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London
economists said. "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement
that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey
of Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S.
With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world." But some
economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major
markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the
turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent
U.S. Trade deficits. "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall
Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other
London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock
prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing
inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such
considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash,
according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. "It would be
suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the
last couple of days to jack up their interest rates," he added. Stocks
surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a
point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged
support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate
fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a
banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also
helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a
European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do
not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep
the underlying fundamentals in mind. "The United States has been able
to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce
slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and)
provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said
Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger. "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted. David Morrison of
Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be
exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations
confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support
currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered
by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES
    CHICAGO, June 2 - 
Currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally
today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not
accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan
Greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said.
Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are
calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8
Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's
attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S.
currency, analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared
to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks
in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said. "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,"
said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff. "The
international community will not like this appointment," as it
suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a
burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the
commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch
Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not
named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's
first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a
bridesmaid," Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher
currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be
mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent
statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West
Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate
cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S.,
on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West
Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S.
commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further
decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, "the
impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes," Horner said.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European
currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges
after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for
September yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said
September marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while
Swiss francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS
    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - 
Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange
houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside
the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made
available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here,
has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by
Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of
international operations. The telex said the restriction on business
with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting
foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the
Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose
foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But
brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency
control. "It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no
longer complete freedom to operate," one broker here said. "Gradually
they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete
control," the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said
virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with
him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the
volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he
said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between
Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. "We weren't buying
dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous," he said. "They've been
on a rampage against foreigners." The broker noted that two months ago
Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign
exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200
pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited
trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. "We used to have a
forward market," he said. "For a small currency it was miraculous." He
said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986,
would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50
because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves
to support the currency on the free market.

ZAMBIA'S KWACHA FALLS AT WEEKLY AUCTION
    LUSAKA, April 13 - 
The Zambian kwacha fell at this week's foreign exchange auction to
18.75 kwacha to the dollar from last week's 16.95, the Bank of Zambia
said. The rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two weeks ago
under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out with the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Bank of Zambia said it
received 370 bids, ranging from 13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln
dlrs on offer. One hundred and thirty-five bids were successful. A
British High Commission spokesman said Britain would put eight mln stg
into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as soon as Zambia reached
a full agreement with the IMF. The money could be spent only on goods
produced and supplied by British firms, excluding luxuries and defence
equipment, the spokesman added.

STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings
of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the
Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told
journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22
agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange
rates near the then-current levels. But he declined to say what
measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of
Seven ministers later today. Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl
Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as
the Louvre accord, had been underestimated. Stoltenberg said there is
greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at
the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its
major trading partners. "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris
accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but
I do not want to discuss that here. Stoltenberg said the Louvre
agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against
the dollar. And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to
support the dollar. "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the
market," he said. Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of
the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth. Poehl said, however, that
Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation. "And
we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they
promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through
Congress," he added. Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about
a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct
against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis. "You
cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And it is not just a
German problem, it is a European problem," he said.

STOLTENBERG ASSUMES COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
The West German government assumes that the commitment to
international monetary cooperation which was renewed in Washington
last month will continue, a Finance Ministry spokesman quoted Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg as saying. Stoltenberg's statement was a
reaction to criticism of rises in West German interest rates voiced by
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker over the weekend.

BONN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON BAKER REMARKS
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
The West German Finance Ministry declined to comment on weekend
criticism by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker of recent West German
interest rate increases. Baker said the U.S. Would re-examine the
February Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading
industrial democracies. The rise in West Germany short term interest
rates was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in
Washington, which reaffirmed the Louvre pact, he said. A Finance
Ministry spokesman, asked for an official ministry reaction to Baker's
remarks, said he could make no comment.

STOLTENBERG DOES NOT RULE OUT INTERVENTION
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he could not
rule out the possibility of central bank intervention to support
currencies. Asked at a news conference whether central banks were
prepared to intervene to defend currencies, he said "We cannot rule
out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign currency
stability." However, he added that in the end, it was market forces
which prevailed.

REAGAN SAYS U.S., ALLIES MUST HONOR ACCORDS ON EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY




STOLTENBERG SAYS BAKER MEETING UNDERSCORES ACCORD
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the meeting on
Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker underscored the
determination of the U.S. And West Germany to continue close
cooperation to stabilise foreign exchange rates. Stoltenberg told a
news conference "The statement released yesterday (Monday) after the
private meeting .... Emphasized our determination to continue the
close economic cooperation regarding foreign exchange stabilization
and monetary policy." Stoltenberg said that he, Baker and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had
all reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their
meeting on Monday. Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several
European counterparts showed that they shared this view. "We expect
the declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect," he
said. He noted that the dollar firmed again in late U.S. Trading after
the outcome of the Baker meeting was published.

KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN
    KUWAIT, June 2 - 
Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits held firm in scattered
trading despite a Central Bank decision to revive limited funding
lines, dealers said. The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily
aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the
facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they
said. It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities,
dealers said. Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of
dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising
from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said.
However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still unsettled."
Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to
30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the
close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct,
ended at 14, eight. Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after
opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an
early 9-1/2, 7-1/2. One month rates were at the same level after trade
at eight then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct
and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one
year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close. The Central Bank fixed its dinar
exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's
0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

FED'S JOHNSON SAYS LOUVRE ACCORD STILL VITAL
    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - 
Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the Louvre
Accord is still healthy, but said the United States and West Germany
must work out differences over their respective roles in fulfilling
the accord. "The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of
stabilizing exchange rates," he said in response to a question during
an American Stock Exchange conference here. He said exchange rates
have been stable so far in 1987 as a result of the accord.

JAPAN'S LDP TO CALL FOR FLEXIBLE MONETARY POLICIES
    TOKYO, April 17 - 
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will call for adequate
and flexible management of the nation's monetary polices in its plan
to expand domestic demand, a senior LDP official told Reuters.
Junichiro Koizumi, the head of the LDP committee working out the plan,
said the phrase should not be taken as implying an immediate cut in
Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. "The LDP generally believes that there
is no need for a further discount rate cut at the moment," he said.
But Koizumi said the LDP does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in
the future. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a press
conference on Wednesday that the central bank does not have any
intention of easing credit conditions.

SUMITA WELCOMES U.S.-JAPAN AGREEMENT ON LOUVRE
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's U.S.
And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre
accord. Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were
excessively concerned about the economic future. The Bank of Japan
will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon
the Louvre accord of February, he said. The accord called for
stability in foreign exchange rates. Exchange rates generally are
regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are
heading for a steady recovery, he said.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 68 MLN STG HELP
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it provided the market with a further 68 mln
stg assistance this afternoon, bringing its total assistance on the
day to 143 mln stg. Shortly before, the Bank said it had revised its
estimate of the shortage up to 450 mln stg from the earlier forecast
of 400 mln. During the afternoon, the bank bought 22 mln stg of band
two bank bills at 9-13/16 pct and two mln stg of local authority bills
plus 44 mln stg of bank bills in band four at 9-11/16 pct. These rates
were in all cases unchanged from previous intervention levels.

BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the
continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency
stability by all major industrial countries. Balladur, responding to
weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the U.S.
Would take another look at the accords, said "I firmly desire a
faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to
the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." On Sunday,
Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates
was not in keeping with the accords. The Louvre accords, agreed in
Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies
after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the
Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker
said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was "not in keeping
with the spirit of what we agreed to." "What I'm really saying is that
they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased
tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going
to follow them," he added.

WEST GERMANY STILL COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
West German government sources said Bonn remained committed to the
Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies, which was struck by leading
western democracies in Paris last February. Over the weekend, U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker criticised recent rises in West German
short-term interest rates and said such developments were not in the
spirit of the Louvre pact. He said the agreement may have to be re-
examined. The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to
be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide.

LAWSON SEES NO CHANGE IN U.K. MONETARY POLICY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he saw no
immediate implications for British monetary policy arising from the
Group of Seven meeting yesterday. "Exchange rate stability is in the
U.K.'s interest," he told journalists. Asked what it meant for U.K.
monetary policy, he said, "No, I do not think there are any immediate
implications."

REAGAN URGES FULFILLMENT OF EXCHANGE ACCORDS
    WASHINGTON, June 1 - 
President Reagan, preparing to depart for the Venice economic summit
on Wednesday, said the United States and its allies must fulfill
agreements on exchange rate stability. "Economic policy decisions made
last year in Tokyo, and at this year's meetings of Group of 7 Finance
ministers in Paris and in Washington, cannot be ignored or forgotten,"
he said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated
into action," Reagan said in a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th
anniversary of the Marshall Plan.

Stoltenberg declines comment on possible changed targets for currencies




FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY
    WASHINGTON, June 18 - 
Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger said there were signs of
helpful stability in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks. "I
think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets," Seger told
reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
"I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period of
stability," she said. She said market forces have a major influence on
exchange rates and said she did not know the right value for the
dollar against the Yen or the Mark. Seger told the Savings and Loan
executives that she was concerned about financial markets' absorption
with exchange rate influences. "I am concerned that we have gotten so
nervous," about exchange rates, Seger said. She said the Fed takes
into account additional factors in determining monetary policy than
the value of the dollar against other currencies. On the economy,
Seger called the latest figures in gross national product a modest
upward revision.

DEUTSCHE BANK CHIEF SAYS LOUVRE PACT STILL INTACT
    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - 
Deutsche Bank AG joint chief executive Friedrich Wilhelm Christians
said he believed the Louvre accord on currency stability was still
intact. Christians told a news conference he met U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks, after short term German
interest rates had risen twice. "I am sure that with 1.7720 marks the
dollar is still within the Louvre agreement. I do not see that the
accord has been terminated," Christians said. He was responding to
questions about comments by Baker, who said the Louvre accord was
still operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates.

G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT
    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - 
International monetary officials will rush to paper over the deep
cracks that have appeared in the Louvre accord on currency stability
to prevent a dollar free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital
markets, economists and currency traders said. "I don't think the
Louvre is dead because if it breaks up in an acrimonious way, the
potential outcome is a rout of the dollar, higher interest rates and
collapsing stock markets. It's in the Group of Seven's interest to
calm things down," said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at
BankAmerica Corp. In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury
secretary James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to foster
exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed. His comments rocked the
currency markets and helped send the already-fragile U.S. and overseas
stock markets into a tailspin. The dollar lost more than two pfennigs
in the U.S. to about 1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35
yen. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at
one stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS
    TOKYO, April 13 - 
The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in deficit financing bills
today through 51-day repurchase agreements maturing June 3 to help
absorb a projected money market surplus, money traders said. The
operation will raise the outstanding supply of the bills to a record
4,800 billion yen. The yield on the bills for sale to banks and
securities houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with
the two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and
the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct. The traders
estimated the surplus today at about 1,800 billion yen. They said it
is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of government tax allocations to
local governments and public entities and to excessive banking system
cash holdings due to continuous large central bank dollar purchases.

BANKS EXTEND TRADING HALT IN LEBANESE POUND
    BEIRUT, Oct 19 - 
Lebanon's Bankers Association said it extended its suspension of
trading in the Lebanese pound for two more working days to study ways
to stem the currency's collapse. The Central Bank did not post the
rate of the pound to the dollar and other currencies on Monday. The
pound closed on Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00. Association sources told Reuters
Friday's suspension of trading for two working days was continued on
Monday for two more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the
pound. The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in east
and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic market after
the pound crashed to four record lows in the week. The pound, hit by
the inability of Lebanon's religiously and ideologically divided
government to end 12 years of civil war, has lost more than 80 pct of
its international value this year.

TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
Treasury Secretary James Baker said the floating exchange rate system
has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and
preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy. In remarks
before the afternoon session of the International Monetary Fund's
Interim Committee, Baker said he was not suggesting that the system
should be abandoned. "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need
something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right
direction when the wind shifts." He said that indicators can serve "as
a kind of compass" but added that structural indicators can help focus
attention on some policies. Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to
move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators
that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today." The Treasury Secretary
said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the
annual economic reviews -- Article IV consultations -- that the Fund
performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was time for
the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF surveillance more
relevant to national policymakers and the public. "In particular, we
urge increased publicity for IMF appraisals developed in Article IV
consultations, the use of follow-up reports on country actions to
implement IMF recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device
"for moving beyond rhetoric to action." He said they provide "more
structure to the system, and induce more discipline and peer pressure
into the process of policy coordination." He said the Fund's
procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect
the use of indicators. "This should be matter of priority for the
executive board," he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop
alternative medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can
help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications
of these options." He said also that further work should be done on
finding paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. "If we
are to take effective remedial action when there are significant
deviations from an intended course, then we must have more definitive
ways of indentifying the right course for key variables," he said.

DELORS CALLS FOR G-7 MEETING
    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 19 - 
European Community Commission President Jacques Delors called for a
swift convening of a meeting of the G-7 countries following the
instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets. He
told a press conference here: "G-7 should meet discreetly and
quickly." Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the
mark to levels around 1.60, the European Monetary System would undergo
a "test by fire." Delors said the current problems in the markets had
been caused by excessive growth in financial trading, excessive
deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy
to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances. He said
it was "profoundly unjust" to blame it on recent increases in West
Germany.

GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR SPECIAL MONETARY MEETING
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
Finance ministers from major industrial nations should hold a special
meeting to deal with the U.S. Dollar's sharp decline, Helmut Geiger,
president of the West German savings bank association, said. Geiger
told Reuters: "Finance ministers should meet soon to take confidence-
building measures to limit the damage caused by the dollar's fall."
Separately, Geiger told Bild newspaper in an interview released ahead
of publication on Tuesday that the lower dollar, which had been
artificially talked down by U.S. officials, would damage West German
exports and cost jobs.

LAWSON SAYS U.S.-WEST GERMAN ROW WAS UNNECESSARY
    LONDON, Oct 20 - 
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the recent dispute
between the United States and West Germany over economic policy was
responsible for much financial turmoil and that it should never have
happened. He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned
fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important between
finance ministers of the major nations. He said the dispute was a row
which should not have happened and agreed that much of the blame lay
with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised
West Germany for having raised its key interest rates.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN LATE HELP OF 210 MLN STG
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it gave the market late assistance of around
210 mln stg, bringing its total help on the day to some 353 mln stg.
This compares with the Bank's estimate of the liquidity shortage of
around 450 mln stg, raised from its early forecast of 400 mln stg.

 Balladur urges G-7 to respect pledges on monetary policy in Louvre accord




BONN CONFIDENT OF MAINTAINING CURRENCY STABILITY
    BONN, Oct 19 - 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in
Frankfurt on Monday, a Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman said. After the
meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident
that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels.
The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing
short-term money market interest rates. He had said the rise was not
in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the
U.S. dollar last February. The meeting had been arranged last week,
the spokesman said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue
the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency
stability and monetary policy. Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak
injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which
money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German
monetary authority to curb interest rate rises. The spokesman
described Monday's talks, which he called private, as very positive.

NEW ZEALAND WILL CONTINUE FIRM MONETARY POLICY
    WELLINGTON, Oct 20 - 
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said there was no evidence to suggest
the fall in share prices had affected financial stability and it would
maintain its firm monetary policy. Governor Spencer Russell said in a
statement the central bank did not accept arguments that the battle
against inflation should now take a low second priority after the
sharemarket's plunge. Russell said the bank had two statutory
responsibilities -- to implement the government's monetary policy to
bring down inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.
"Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary policy will
continue because it is very much in the national interest that it do
so," he said. "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to
suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the stability of
the financial sector." The Barclays share index fell a record 504.75
points to 2,925,26 on Tuesday, a decline of 14.7 pct.

POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK
    FRANKFURT, June 2 - 
For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is the scourge of speculators,
for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the
world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for Germans he
is the guardian of the mark. President of the powerful and independent
West German central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of
this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights,
see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl
spent seven years in Bonn in top ministerial posts under the Social
Democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There
has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try to replace
Poehl with a man closer to his own Christian Democrats. But officials
noted that Poehl has worked closely and successfully with Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in
1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul Volcker of
the United States, enjoys a strong international reputation which it
would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances,
Kohl will probably overlook Poehl's past as an adviser to former
Social Democrat Chancellor Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut
Schmidt when he was Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt
who, as Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In
recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, Poehl
has made exchange rates the central concern of the Bundesbank's
council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued
monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. Older Germans
can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century. But with
consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so
far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a
little and concentrate on the dangers to the German economy of a
bloated exchange rate. "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise
the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would
endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business journalists in
Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says
that Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so
rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy," she
said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to be identified,
said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus
for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards
money supply." One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that the
United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies. The
Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said
they would soon put it to the test. But in fact the dollar has been
relatively stable since the pact. "This is because the markets know -
or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,"
Poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn
rates round, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born
in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before
starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who
enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype
central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch
football and play golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot
substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are
imbalanced. "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small
amount if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of many
people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes, the
Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
The Louvre accord on currency stability, which has maintained an
uneasy calm in currency markets since last February, appeared in
serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German
interest rates came to the boil, foreign exchange dealers said. But as
the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets
plunged, officials in the major industrial countries played down the
dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West
Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive. U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he
attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates. "That's
not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as
earlier this month in Washington," Baker said in a U.S. Television
interview on Sunday. He was referring to the meetings of Finance
Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations
which reaffirmed the pact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and
Japan, who both have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their
economic growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on
Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative, the West
German interest rate move would force the U.S. To re-examine the
accord. "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's
going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets are off in
terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency analyst at UBS-
Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a
much more sanguine view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is
apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the
Baker comment will regret it later on." French Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur, who hosted the Louvre meeting, was the only one of
the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks. He
called for "a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial
countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."
Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury
commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said
that despite U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this
does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord." In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief
executive of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S. Was
still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted
as a possible gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-
term liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on Monday,
down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected medium-term
liquidity last week. The Bank of France also stepped into the French
money market to hold down rates, injecting short-term liquidity at
7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct.

FED EXPECTED TO SET THREE-DAY REPURCHASE PACTS
    NEW YORK, April 13 - 
The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government
securities market to add temporary reserves directly by arranging
three-day System repurchase agreements, economists said. They said the
Fed may add the reserves indirectly instead via a large round, two
billion dlrs or more, of customer repurchase agreements. Federal
funds, which averaged a high 6.35 pct on Friday, opened at 6-7/16 pct
and traded between there and 6-1/2 pct.

Miyazawa says Baker's remarks were aimed at just reaffirming Louvre agreement




LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL
    LONDON, June 2 - 
The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has
carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to
stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven
industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was "content" with sterling's
current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted "to maintain the
exchange rate stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say
if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May
currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise,
pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a
hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We
have been playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our
commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. "We
wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added. Asked which
techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both
central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to
tackle "the market pressures there are from time to time." "Interest
rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be
moved up and down at times," he added. Lawson said he expected
intervention to be "sterilised" by draining excess sterling liquidity
from the market through new issues of government securities and
foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the
inflationary impact of intervention, he said. "Sterilisation will be
dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which
intervention occurs," Lawson said. "I am confident that we can
sterilise on this scale."

BAKER REMARKS AIMED AT CONFIRMING ACCORD-MIYAZAWA
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that remarks by U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker on Sunday that some nations were not
abiding by the spirit of the Louvre Accord were just aimed at
reaffirming that agreement. The agreement, to cooperate in stabilising
currencies, was reached in Paris in February this year. The finance
minister made the remark at a news conference which followed a morning
cabinet meeting.

LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS
    LONDON, Oct 20 - 
U.S. And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord
cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy
which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets, London
economists said. "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement
that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey
of Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the U.S.
With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world." But some
economists added that Wall Street's crash, which dragged other major
markets down with it, may help curb the very problems that sparked the
turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent
U.S. Trade deficits. "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall
Street ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from other
London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock
prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing
inflationary pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such
considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash,
according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. "It would be
suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the
last couple of days to jack up their interest rates," he added. Stocks
surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a
point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged
support for the financial system. The news eroded the most immediate
fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy, via a
banking crisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also
helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of 1.8200 marks from a
European low of 1.7880. But economists said today's whiplash moves do
not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep
the underlying fundamentals in mind. "The United States has been able
to live on borrowed time. If the effect of this (crash) is to produce
slower economic growth not recession...It contains good news (and)
provides a more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said
Capel's Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger. "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted. David Morrison of
Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be
exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations
confirms a base for the dollar, as implied by West German Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support
currencies is still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered
by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.

NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES
    CHICAGO, June 2 - 
Currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally
today after President Reagan announced that Paul Volcker would not
accept a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan
Greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said.
Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation, analysts are
calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the June 8
Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's
attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S.
currency, analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared
to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks
in Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said. "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,"
said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol Mackoff. "The
international community will not like this appointment," as it
suggests the possibility that the U.S. budget deficit is too much of a
burden on monetary policy and that Volcker was unable to get the
commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch
Economics analyst David Horner. Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not
named two months ago suggests that he was not the Administration's
first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a
bridesmaid," Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher
currency futures prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be
mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent
statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West
Germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate
cuts, despite pressure from the U.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S.,
on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as Japan and West
Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S.
commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further
decline in the dollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, "the
impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing changes," Horner said.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane said European
currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges
after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for
September yen f
 Stoltenberg says he assumes monetary cooperation will continue




U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER MEETS WEST GERMAN MINISTER
    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in
West Germany and agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury
Department said. The Treasury described the meeting as "a very
positive, private meeting in Frankfurt, West Germany which had been
agreed upon last week. "The parties agreed to continue economic
cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible application
including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary
policies," the Treasury said. The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg
"are consulting with their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this
will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current
levels." The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries including the United States and West
Germany to promote currency stability. Baker was scheduled to visit
Scandinavia and Belgium this week and the department earlier refused
to release details of his travel itinerary, citing security
considerations.

LAWSON WELCOMES REAFFIRMATION OF LOUVRE ACCORD
    LONDON, October 19 - 
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson welcomed on Monday the
reaffirmation by the U.S. And West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed
at stabilising currencies. His office said Lawson had welcomed the
outcome of a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, and West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt. After the meeting, a Bonn finance
ministry spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that
foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels. The
meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing key
interest rates, saying they were not in line with last February's
Louvre accord.

IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street, Japanese will finally move
out of dollar investments in a serious way, Japan investment managers
say. The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
securities, have already sold U.S. Equities. But "if the dollar falls
steeply, which did not happen yesterday, Japanese investors will
definitely try to withdraw significant funds from U.S. Shares," said
Akira Kawakami, deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and
Management Co Ltd's international investment department. An unstable,
lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in U.S. Bonds.
"Japan-U.S. Interest rate differentials, which currently look wide
enough, mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability," said
Kawakami. U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect should be
to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise. But most Japanese investors
in U.S. Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable,
he said. The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday
morning. "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to lighten
their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager of Meiji
Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said.
Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1,738,
the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914. "Investment in U.S.
Stocks and bonds is difficult, considering the dangers," said
Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general manager and chief adviser of
Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group.
Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have
stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers said. The Tokyo yen bond
market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks, which is what
investors have been waiting for. The bottom for yen bonds should be
around a 6.3 pct yield for the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said. "The
basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has
not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant general manager of Nikko
Securities' bond department. "But new outflows of funds to the U.S.
Will be decreasing." However, this was already evident three months
ago, he said.

FRANCE'S BALLADUR SAYS TARGET ZONE NOTION NEARER
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that the financial
community is closer to arriving at a system of target zones for
currencies despite the fact that little is being said about them.
Speaking with reporters at the semiannual meetings of the
International Monetary Fund, Balladur said, "We are not very far from
the notion of target zones, even if we don't say so." He told
reporters that "our ideas are progressing," adding that the finance
ministers have been talking about more cooperation on economic
policies and on levels around which currencies should stabilize.

BALLADUR HAS HAD CONTACT WITH G-7 MINISTERS
    PARIS, Oct 20 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur has been in contact with
several Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries, in particular West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg, to discuss the crisis on world markets, Finance Ministry
sources said. They did not say whether the contacts had led to
concerted action on the markets or merely an exchange of views. But
they added that French ministry officials were continuing the contacts
to exchange views on market performance.

U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT REMOVED
    LONDON, April 9 - 
The Bank of England said it has satisfied its revised estimate of
today's shortfall in the money market, providing 261 mln stg
assistance in afternoon operations. The Bank bought in band one, 60
mln stg bank bills at 9-7/8 pct and in band two 200 mln stg bank bills
and one mln stg treasury bills at 9-13/16 pct. This brings the total
help so far today to 364 mln stg, compared with its deficit estimate
of 350 mln stg.

GROUP OF FIVE MEETING ENDS
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
A meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of
Five ended after nearly three and a half hours. West German Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson declined to comment on the meeting as they emerged from
the U.S. Treasury. A European monetary official said the ministers of
the Group of Seven countries would gather at about three p.m. local
(1900 GMT) at the Treasury.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 25 MLN STG LATE ASSISTANCE
    LONDON, June 1 - 
The Bank of England said it provided the money market with late
assistance of around 25 mln stg. This takes the Bank's total help
today to some 137 mln stg and compares with its latest forecast of a
150 mln stg shortage.

TOP OFFICIALS ARRIVE AT TREASURY FOR G-5 TALKS
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
Top officials of leading industrial nations arrived at the U.S.
Treasury main building to begin a meeting of the Group of Five.
Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included West German
Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl
Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and his central
banker Jacques de Larosiere. Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi
Sumita and British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank
governor Robin Leigh Pemberton. There was no immediate sign of Italian
or Canadian officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown
meeting of the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when a
communique is expected to be issued. Italian sources said Italian
acting Finance Minister Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James
Baker last night. At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven in
Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful decisions.

Sumita welcomes U.S.-West German joint confirmation of Louvre accord




LEBANESE POUND FALLS SHARPLY AGAINST DOLLAR
    BEIRUT, April 9 - 
The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against the U.S. Dollar again today
with dealers attributing the decline to continued political
uncertainty. The pound closed at 118.25/118.75 against the dollar
compared to yesterday's close of 115.60/115.80. "Political deadlock is
reflected in the pound's position. There was more demand and less on
offer in the market," one dealer told Reuters. The pound, which was at
18 to the dollar in January, 1986, has lost more than 30 pct of its
international value over the past three months.

TREASURY'S BAKER MET WEST GERMANY'S STOLTENBERG TODAY, AGREED TO SUPPORT LOUVRE PACT




FED'S SEGER SAYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS SHOWING SIGNS
OF STABILITY




U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
Treasury Secretary James Baker said that changes in exchange rates
have generally been orderly and have improved the prospects for a
reduction in external imbalances to more sustainable levels. In
remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee, Baker
reiterated a Group of Seven statement last night that the substantial
exchange rate changes since the Plaza agreement 18 months ago have
"now brought currencies within ranges broadly consistent with economic
fundamentals." Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally
been orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels." As they are today,
the trade and current account imbalances "simply are not sustainable,"
Baker told the ministers. He said that the Reagan administration was
resisting "strong domestic pressure" for trade protection and was
working closely with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
"While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing what we can
to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he said. Baker also
urged the International Monetary Fund's executive board to review
possible modifications to the Fund's compensatory financing facility
before the annual meeting this fall. "We should pay particular
attention to the lack of continuing conditionality associated with the
use of the CFF and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

BALLADUR URGES G-7 TO RESPECT LOUVRE ACCORD
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrial countries should respect pledges on monetary policy made in
the February Louvre accord on currency stability. "We have to
strengthen the cooperation between the seven major industrial
countries and remind ourselves of the pledges we made at the Louvre,"
he told journalists. "They were not simply pledges to maintain
currency stability, but also to conduct a certain type of economic and
monetary policy," he added. Balladur's comments came after U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker said on Sunday that the U.S. Would have
to re-examine the Louvre accords in the light of the rise in West
German short-term interest rates. Balladur was one of the main
architects of the Louvre accord and has invested considerable
political capital in defending them.

BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the
continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency
stability by all major industrial countries. Balladur, responding to
weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the U.S.
Would take another look at the accords, said "I firmly desire a
faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to
the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit." On Sunday,
Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates
was not in keeping with the accords. The Louvre accords, agreed in
Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies
after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the
Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker
said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was "not in keeping
with the spirit of what we agreed to." "What I'm really saying is that
they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased
tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going
to follow them," he added.

U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 75 MLN STG ASSISTANCE
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it had provided the money market with 75 mln
stg help in the morning session. This compares with the Bank's
estimate that the system would face a shortage of around 400 mln stg
today. The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising two mln
stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct, 15 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct
and 58 mln stg in band three at 9-11/16 pct.

LOUVRE ACCORD VITAL TO W.GERMANY - STOLTENBERG
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the Louvre
accord was vital to West Germany. Stoltenberg told a news conference
"Given West Germany's unusually high dependence on world trade and
exports, it is vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive
contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the basis of
the Louvre accord." Some monetary analysts have speculated that
inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger may
have been leading the central bank to a course of tighter monetary
policy. Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting on
Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if any, policy
decisions the Bundesbank might take.

GROUP OF 10 WELCOMES LATEST G-7 AGREEMENT
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
The Group of 10 developed nations issued a communique welcoming the
reaffirmation of the Paris accord on currency stability by the Group
of Seven leading industrial democracies yesterday. In the communique
issued this morning, the G-10 said "prospects of member countries'
economies would be improved by stability in the exchange rates of
their currencies." The G-10 includes the group of seven - the United
States, Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy, West Germany and France - plus
Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and also Switzerland. Sources who
attended the G-10 conference this morning said the reference to the
latest G-7 agreement was especially added to the brief communique
because currency stability will benefit all the G-10 members. The G-10
met briefly before the International Monetary Fund Interim Committee
meeting scheduled for today. .

INDUSTRIAL NATIONS RECONVENE FOR TALKS
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
Financial ministers and central bankers of leading industrial nations
reconvened here this afternoon. Canadian Finance Minister Michael
Wilson said on entering the meeting the ministers would review the
Paris agreement. Asked if he was satisfied with West German and
Japanese stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more."
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile, confirmed there
would be a communique at the end of the meeting. Finance ministers and
central bankers of Britain, FRance, Canada and West Germany were seen
by Reuter correspondents returning to a Treasury building. Japanese
officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl did not appear to
have left the building at the end of earlier Group of Five talks which
broke up around 2 p.m. local time (1800 gmt). There was no sign,
however, of the Italian delegation whose position was thrown into
question this morning by the resignation of the Christian Democratic
wing of Italy's Socialist-led government. European monetary officials
said later that the Italian delegation was inside the building. This
meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven was in progress.

FED SEEN ADDING RESERVES VIA SYSTEM REPOS
    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - 
The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the government securities
market to supply reserves to the banking system via system repurchase
agreements, economists said. Most economists said the Fed would
execute three-day system repurchases to meet a substantial need to add
reserves in the current maintenance period, although some said a more
aggressive add via overnight system repos was possible. Federal funds
opened at 7-5/8 pct and remained at that level late this morning,
compared with an average effective rate of 7.55 pct Friday.

POEHL SEES GOOD CHANCES FOR CURRENCY STABILITY
    FRANKFURT, Oct 20 - 
Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl said there were good chances for
exchange rate stability. "The chances for exchange rate stability are
good," he told reporters.

BALLADUR URGES G-7 TO RESPECT LOUVRE ACCORD
    PARIS, Oct 19 - 
French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrial countries should respect pledges on monetary policy made in
the February Louvre accord on currency stability. "We have to
strengthen the cooperation between the seven major industrial
countries and remind ourselves of the pledges we made at the Louvre,"
he told journalists. "They were not simply pledges to maintain
currency stability, but also to conduct a certain type of economic and
monetary policy," he added.

KENYA DEVALUES SHILLING BY 0.6 PCT AGAINST SDR
    NAIROBI, April 13 - 
Kenya devalued the shilling by 0.6 pct against the special drawing
right (SDR) in response to the decline of the dollar last last week,
bankers said. The Central Bank of Kenya set the shilling at 20.7449 to
the SDR compared with the 20.6226 rate in force since the last
devaluation on March 31. The Kenyan shilling has lost 5.6 pct of its
value against the SDR this year in a series of devaluations designed
to keep the value of the dollar above 16 shillings.

MIYAZAWA SAYS G-7 STILL SUPPORTS LOUVRE ACCORD
    TOKYO, Oct 20 - 
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven
(G-7) nations still support the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies.
He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting that the
Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to meet for talks.
The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock market plunges
will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock market. "There is no
special worry about the stock market in Tokyo," he added. Miyazawa
said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by the
downturns of markets in New York and London because there is a clear
sign of an economic recovery in Japan and stability of exchange rates.
Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock market plunge in
New York, Miyazawa said there was not any contact.

SWISS TO LAUNCH NEW SERIES OF MONEY MARKET PAPER
    ZURICH, April 9 - 
The Swiss Federal Government will launch a new series of three month
money market certificates totalling around 150 mln Swiss francs, the
National Bank said. Subscriptions close April 14 and payment date is
April 16. The last series of three month paper issued in March raised
147.3 mln francs at an issue price of 99.142 pct, giving an average
annual yield of 3.501 pct.

U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 400 MLN STG
    LONDON, April 13 - 
The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 400 mln stg
in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity,
bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills
will drain some 1.085 billion stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, a
fall in note circulation will add some 340 mln stg, exchequer
transactions around 300 mln and bankers' balances above target about
50 mln.

U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FELL 896 MLN DLRS
    WASHINGTON, June 19 - 
Business loans on the books of major U.S. banks, excluding
acceptances, fell 896 mln dlrs to 275.61 billion in the week ended
June 10, the Federal Reserve Board said. The Fed said that business
loans including acceptances fell 546 mln dlrs to 278.12 billion dlrs.

FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY
    WASHINGTON, April 9 - 
Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on
the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more
action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic
growth. In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S.
Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the
dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they
welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy.
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a "good
meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers
seemed pleased with its outcome. Shortly after the communique was
issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank
of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly. The
communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the
commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris
meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential
to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic
expansion and reduce trade imbalances." It welcomed the plans set this
week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its
economy with what the communique termed "extraordinary and urgent
measures" including an "unprecedented front-end loading of public
works expenditures." The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven
brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada. The communique said the ministers
reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on
February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign
exchange rates at the then-current levels. In the weeks that followed,
the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive
dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is
now trading at around postwar lows. Japan has come under growing
criticism from both the United States and European countries for its
only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to
reduce its exports. The communique said Japan affirmed its intention
to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
elaborate. It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around
current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent
with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at
the Louvre meeting."

WHITE HOUSE SAYS U.S. MONETARY POLICY CORRECT
    SANTA BARBARA, Calif, April 17 - 
The White House, distancing itself from remarks by the
administration's budget chief, said the Federal Reserve's current
course of monetary policy was appropriate. "The administration feels
that the current course of monetary policy is appropriate," White
House spokesman Marlin Fitwater said. Fitzwater said the
administration did not endorse remarks by White House budget chief
James Miller, who said he was concerned the Federal Reserve might
overreact to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by raising
interest rates. More 

STOLTENBERG DECLINES COMMENT ON CURRENCY ZONES
    BONN, Oct 20 - 
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg declined to comment
on whether unpublished target zones for currencies agreed at last
February's Louvre accord had been changed as a result of the meeting
on Monday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. He was asked about
target zones at a news conference in Bonn. Stoltenberg referred to a
statement released after Monday's meeting, which said continuing
cooperation was aimed at promoting currency stability at current
levels. This was the same formula used in the text of the Louvre
accord, he noted.

LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY
    LONDON, June 2 - 
The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and
central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no
fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June
8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Previewing
the summit, which he expected would not produce any major new economic
initiatives, Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on
improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth.side
measures to boost growth, he said. "I think it is possible that there
may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he
added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the
U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over
the next two or three years." He said the February 22 Louvre accord
had produced "satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to
heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and he
was "content" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record
4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May currency reserves announced today he
said, "we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... We have
been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done
hitherto." Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
commitments underlying the accord. "Certainly it would be more
difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen
not to implement their commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He
said the U.S. Budget deficit was "very important." Noting the 6,000
billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said, "what is really needed in
Japan is an increase in merchandise imports. Supply side measures are
critical." "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly
unjustified," he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would
indulge in "Japan bashing" at the summit especially after the economic
stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to
increase Japanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's
more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also
help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would
instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation
measures to jack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson
said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its
agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn
to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries. On
debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate
the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in
Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank
meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek
"to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit"
and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of
the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions.
"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market response
has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move
than they felt before Citicorp," he said. U.K. Banks should follow
Bank of England recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets
and making more provisions. "They have done it to some extent, they
need to do it more," Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks
themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions. He also
said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the
summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to push further."

G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA
    WASHINGTON, April 8 - 
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven
(G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising
currencies to convince the market of their resolve. At a news
conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and
central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was
needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals,
and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the
goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said. He also noted that this
test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while
other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable. Miyazawa
said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not
worth being called fundamental. "As I said at a time of Louvre
(agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"
he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a
vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an
adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was
committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was
exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the
dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable. He also
said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a
package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to
produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.
Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor
products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect
the currency talks. The seven nations discussed the debt problems of
developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt
initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months
ago.

TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
    TAIPEI, June 2 - 
Taiwan's central bank announced that as from today the overseas
foreign exchange borrowings of local and foreign banks would be frozen
at the level they reached at the end of May. The central bank's
statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of
July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that
the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock
market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to
importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and
foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that
from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from
banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the
move was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange
market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have
been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to
avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S.
Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs
against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings
must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time
of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct
in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March
the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign
exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb
inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the
rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S.
Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September
1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S.
Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign
exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital
outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by
the end of July or early August. Foreign exchange dealers said today's
announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks
making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank
sold about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Taiwan's stock market plunged a record
75.53 points to close at 1,803.08.

VENEZUELA PROBES ALLEGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FRAUD
    CARACAS, June 28 - 
Banking authorities and police are investigating an alleged fraud by
the second largest trading house in the Caracas free foreign exchange
market, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters. The
Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial Police have
both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said on Friday night.
Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his brother Luigi
Muggia, have left Venezuela. Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the
"parallel market" in which traders buy and sell dollars among
themselves. The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the
licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market,
blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the
U.S. Dollar here. Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas
Stock Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house, said
on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la Guiara for
issuing him four checks without funds for a total amount of almost one
mln dlrs. The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in
Venezuela for more than 20 years.

REAGAN SAYS U.S. COMMITTED TO LOUVRE ACCORD
    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - 
President Reagan said the United States remains committed to the
Louvre accord in which the seven major industrial nations agreed to
stabilize currency exchange rates. "The United States remains
committed to the Louvre agreement," Reagan said in a statement
following a meeting with his top economic advisers. Reagan said the
United States, Japan and West Germany had all reaffirmed their
commitment to coordinate economic policies. Reagan said Japanese Prime
Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita said in a telephone conversation
Tuesday morning that "his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain
stable economic relations with the United States." Reagan noted that
Treasury Secretary James Baker met with West German financial
officials and reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre agreement.
They "reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic policies to
provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates," Reagan
said.
