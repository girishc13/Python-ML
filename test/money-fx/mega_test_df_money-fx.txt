stoltenberg
sees
moves
to
strengthen
paris
accord
washington
april
west
german
finance
minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
said
today
s
meetings
of
major
industrial
countries
would
look
at
ways
of
strengthening
the
paris
accord
on
stabilizing
foreign
exchange
rates
stoltenberg
told
journalists
he
saw
no
fundamental
weakness
of
the
february
agreement
of
the
group
of
five
countries
and
canada
to
keep
exchange
rates
near
the
then
current
levels
but
he
declined
to
say
what
measures
would
be
discussed
ahead
of
a
communique
of
the
group
of
seven
ministers
later
today
stoltenberg
and
bundesbank
president
karl
otto
poehl
said
the
importance
of
the
paris
agreement
also
known
as
the
louvre
accord
had
been
underestimated
stoltenberg
said
there
is
greater
agreement
now
among
major
countries
than
six
months
ago
at
the
time
of
the
annual
meeting
of
the
international
monetary
fund
and
world
bank
marked
by
sharp
discord
between
the
united
states
and
its
major
trading
partners
there
is
no
fundamental
weakness
of
the
paris
accord
he
said
we
will
be
looking
at
ways
of
strengthening
it
but
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
that
here
stoltenberg
said
the
louvre
agreement
was
working
despite
a
slight
firming
of
the
yen
against
the
dollar
and
poehl
noted
that
the
dollar
mark
parity
was
unchanged
since
february
without
the
bundesbank
having
had
to
sell
marks
to
support
the
dollar
the
louvre
agreement
has
been
honored
by
the
market
he
said
poehl
said
west
germany
had
lived
up
to
its
side
of
the
bargain
in
paris
by
preparing
the
way
for
tax
cuts
to
be
accelerated
as
a
way
of
stimulating
growth
poehl
said
however
that
japan
had
not
yet
fulfilled
its
pledges
for
economic
stimulation
and
we
will
have
to
see
if
the
united
states
is
able
to
do
what
they
promised
in
paris
on
reducing
the
budget
deficit
and
get
it
through
congress
he
added
stoltenberg
reiterated
west
german
concern
about
a
further
fall
in
the
dollar
noting
that
the
mark
was
up
pct
against
the
dollar
and
nearly
pct
on
a
trade
weighted
basis
you
cannot
expect
that
to
go
unnoticed
in
an
economy
and
it
is
not
just
a
german
problem
it
is
a
european
problem

out
the

added

in

washington

treasury
secretary
james
baker
said
the
floating
exchange
rate
system
has
not
been
as
effective
as
had
been
hoped
in
promoting
stability
and
preventing
imbalances
from
emerging
in
the
global
economy
in
remarks
before
the
afternoon
session
of
the
international
monetary
fund
s
interim
committee
baker
said
he
was
not
suggesting
that
the
system
should
be
abandoned
but
i
do
suggest
he
said
that
we
need
something
to
give
it
more
stability
and
to
keep
it
headed
in
the
right
direction
when
the
wind
shifts
he
said
that
indicators
can
serve
as
a
kind
of
compass
but
added
that
structural
indicators
can
help
focus
attention
on
some
policies
baker
however
said
the
imf
needs
to
move
beyond
macroeconomic
indicators
and
find
structural
indicators
that
can
help
focus
attention
on
some
of
the
policies
of
specific
relevance
to
the
imbalances
we
face
today
the
treasury
secretary
said
that
indicators
should
be
given
a
more
prominent
role
in
the
annual

reviews
article
iv
consultations
that
the

performs
baker
also
told
the
policy
making
group
that
it
was
time
for
the
imf
to
adopt
earlier
recommendations
making
imf
surveillance
more
relevant
to
national
policymakers
and
the
public
in
particular
we
urge
increased
publicity
for
imf
appraisals
developed
in
article
iv
consultations
the
use
of
follow
up
reports
on
country
actions
to
implement
imf
recommendations
and
greater
use
of
special
consultation
procedures
he
said
baker
emphasized
that
indicators
were
a
device
for
moving
beyond
rhetoric
to
action
he
said
they
provide
more
structure
to
the
system
and
induce
more
discipline
and
peer
pressure
into
the
process
of
policy
coordination
he
said
the
fund
s
procedures
for
surveillance
need
to
be
reviewed
and
updated
to
reflect
the
use
of
indicators
this
should
be
matter
of
priority
for
the
executive
board
he
said
baker
also
urged
the
fund
to
develop
alternative
medium
term
economic
scenarios
for
countries
that
can
help
us
focus
even
more
clearly
on
the
most
important
imbalances
by
identifying
options
for
addressing
them
and
analyzing
the
implications
of
these
options
he
said
also
that
further
work
should
be
done
on
finding
paths
that
lead
toward
possible
medium
term
objectives
if
we
are
to
take
effective
remedial
action
when
there
are
significant
deviations
from
an
intended
course
then
we
must
have
more
definitive
ways
of
indentifying
the
right
course
for
key

nigel
lawson
said
the
recent
dispute
between
the

over

was
responsible
for
much
financial
turmoil
and
that
it

never

he
said
in

the

had
fanned

of
a

in

is
so
important
between

he
said
the

was
a
row
which
should
not
have
happened
and
agreed
that
much
of
the
blame
lay
with
u

as
saying
he
was
confident
that

the

came
after

criticised
west

for
increasing

he
had
said
the

was
not
in

with
the

last

the

had

the

that

now
take

after

russell
said
the

had
two
statutory
responsibilities
to
implement

policy
to
bring

and
to
ensure
the

unless

is

otherwise
the

will
continue
because
it

very
much
in

that
it
do
so
he
said
and
there
is

no

available

but
no

has

been
made
raising
eyebrows
in
west
germany
s
business
community
the
ebullient
poehl
spent
seven
years
in
bonn
in
top
ministerial
posts
under
the
social
democrats
now
in
opposition
before
he
moved
to
the
bundesbank
there
has
been
speculation
that
chancellor
helmut
kohl
would
try
to
replace
poehl
with
a
man
closer
to
his
own
christian
democrats
but
officials
noted
that
poehl
has
worked
closely
and
successfully
with
finance
minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
since
kohl
s
government
took
office
in
poehl
the
most
senior
central
banker
apart
from
paul
volcker
of
the
united
states
enjoys
a
strong
international
reputation
which
it
would
take
a
newcomer
years
to
build
up
given
these
circumstances
kohl
will
probably
overlook
poehl
s
past
as
an
adviser
to
former
social
democrat
chancellor
willy
brandt
and
top
aide
to
helmut
schmidt
when
he
was
finance
minister
bankers
said
it
was
schmidt
who
as
chancellor
appointed
poehl
to
his
present
job
in
in
recent
months
with
the
mark
s
strong
rise
against
the
dollar
poehl
has
made
exchange
rates
the
central
concern
of
the
bundesbank
s
council
a
highly
conservative
institution
which
has
doggedly
pursued
monetary
policies
to
prevent
inflation
catching
hold
older
germans
can
remember
two
bouts
of
galloping
inflation
this
century
but
with
consumer
prices
falling
for
much
of
and
inflation
negligible
so
far
this
year
poehl
thinks
it
is
safe
to
relax
the
monetary
reins
a
little
and
concentrate
on
the
dangers
to
the
german
economy
of
a
bloated
exchange
rate
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
efforts
to
stabilise
the
dollar
mark
rate
have
reached
a
high
priority
also
for
the
bundesbank
because
a
further
massive
revaluation
of
the
mark
would
endanger
the
economy
in
west
germany
he
told
business
journalists
in
frankfurt
recently
ute
geipel
head
of
research
at
citibank
ag
says
that
poehl
s
reappointment
would
guarantee
flexible
monetary
policy
poehl
s
policy
has
always
been
a
policy
which
does
not
focus
so
rigidly
on
domestic
factors
but
also
on
the
external
economy
she
said
an
economist
at
a
german
bank
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
if
poehl
is
confirmed
in
his
post
it
will
certainly
be
a
plus
for
the
pragmatic
course
which
is
not
so
rigidly
oriented
towards
money
supply
one
of
poehl
s
great
struggles
recently
has
been
to
persuade
the
united
states
to
stop
talking
down
the
dollar
for
poehl
the
significance
of
the
february
louvre
accord
was
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
join
efforts
to
stabilise
currencies
the
louvre
accord
was
greeted
with
scepticism
by
currency
dealers
who
said
they
would
soon
put
it
to
the
test
but
in
fact
the
dollar
has
been
relatively
stable
since
the
pact
this
is
because
the
markets
know
or
perhaps
because
they
don
t
know
what
the
central
banks
can
do
poehl
says
of
intervention
in
currency
markets
which
can
quickly
turn
rates
round
making
a
speculator
s
position
worthless
poehl
was
born
in
and
worked
as
a
financial
journalist
in
the
before
starting
his
ministerial
career
a
relaxed
sun
tanned
figure
who
enjoys
cracking
jokes
over
a
glass
of
beer
he
is
hardly
a
stereotype
central
banker
he
is
also
a
keen
sportsman
who
likes
to
watch
football
and
play
golf
poehl
says
currency
market
intervention
cannot
substitute
for
correct
economic
policies
if
exchange
rates
are
imbalanced
but
you
can
achieve
an
enormous
effect
with
a
small
amount
if
you
strike
at
the
right
moment
he
said
bundesbank
dealers
are
very
professional
and
skilled
they
ve
burnt
the
fingers
of

the

as
the

in

played
down

problem
between

and
insisted
that

was
still
alive
u

treasury
secretary
james

sparked
the
market
fears
when
he
attacked
the
rise
in

german
short
term
interest
rates
that
s
not
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
what
we
agreed
to
as
recently
as
earlier
this
month
in
washington
baker
said
in
a
u
s
television
interview
on
sunday
he
was
referring
to
the
meetings
of
finance
ministers
from
the
group
of
seven
leading
industrial
nations
which
reaffirmed
the
pact
under
the
louvre
accord
west
germany
and
japan
who
both
have
large
trade
surpluses
pledged
to
boost
their
economic
growth
to
take
in
more
exports
from
the
u
s
while
the
u
s
agreed
to
stop
talking
the
dollar
down
however
baker
said
on
saturday
that
while
the
louvre
agreement
was
still
operative
the
west
german
interest
rate
move
would
force
the
u
s
to
re
examine
the
accord
the
foreign
exchange
market
has
been
told
by
baker
that
he
s
going
to
hammer
germany
he
has
just
declared
all
bets
are
off
in
terms
of
currency
cooperation
chris
johns
currency
analyst
at
ubs
phillips
and
drew
in
london
said
but
a
bank
of
japan
official
took
a
much
more
sanguine
view
telling
reuters
that
the
exchange
market
is
apparently
reacting
too
much
and
anyone
who
sold
the
dollar
on
the
baker
comment
will
regret
it
later
on
french
finance
minister
edouard
balladur
who
hosted
the
louvre
meeting
was
the
only
one
of
the
finance
ministers
to
respond
directly
to
baker
s
remarks
he
called
for
a
faithful
and
firm
adherence
by
all
the
major
industrial
countries
to
the
louvre
accords
in
both
their
letter
and
spirit
neither
the
west
german
finance
ministry
nor
the
british
treasury
commented
on
the
row
but
a
japanese
finance
ministry
official
said
that
despite

frustration
over

this
does
not

he

lawson

we

ourselves
in

our

toward

as
agreed
in

we
wish
to
see
it
stability
continuing
he
added
asked
which
techniques
were
available
to
preserve
stability
lawson
said
both
central
bank
intervention
and
interest
rate
changes
could
be
used
to
tackle
the
market
pressures
there
are
from
time
to
time
interest
rate
stability
is
not
an
objective
in
that
sense
rates
have
to
be
moved
up
and
down
at
times
he
added
lawson
said
he
expected
intervention
to
be
sterilised
by
draining
excess
sterling
liquidity
from
the
market
through
new
issues
of
government
securities
and
foreign
currency
sales
when
the
market
allowed
this
would
limit
the
inflationary
impact
of
intervention
he
said
sterilisation
will
be
dictated
by
market
tactics
not
necessarily
in
the
month
in
which
intervention
occurs
lawson
said
i
am
confident
that
we
can

this
scale

london
economists
said
there
s
going
to
have
to
be
some
acknowledgement
that
the

is
going
to
be
allowed
to
slip
said
richard
jeffrey
of
hoare
govett
if
not
there
is
going
to
be
continued
fear
that
when
pressure
emerges
on
the
dollar
the
fed
will
be
forced
to
tighten
this
throws
up
the
economic
abyss
of
recession
in
the
u
s
with
obvious
knock
on
effects
on
the
rest
of
the
world
but
some
economists
added
that
wall
street
s
crash
which
dragged
other
major
markets
down
with
it
may
help
curb
the
very
problems
that
sparked
the
turmoil
namely
world
inflation
fears
and
the
massive
and
persistent
u
s
trade
deficits
if
there
is
a
benefit
from
a
pct
fall
in
wall
street
it
s
some
sort
of
resistance
to
inflation
worldwide
said
geoffrey
dennis
of

james
capel
echoing
comments
from
other
london
and
tokyo
analysts
lower
personal
wealth
from
lower
stock
prices
and
fears
of
further
falls
should
dampen
credit
growth
curbing
inflationary
pressures
and
import
demand
in
the
u
s
they
say
such
considerations
may
be
helping
bond
markets
resist
the
equity
crash
according
to
mike
osborne
of
kleinwort
grieveson
it
would
be
suicidal
for
any
government
in
the
context
of
what
happened
in
the
last
couple
of
days
to
jack
up
their
interest
rates
he
added

after

chemical

cut
its

lending
rate
half
a
point
to
pct
tuesday
and
u
s
fed
chairman
alan
greenspan
pledged
support
for
the
financial
system
the
news
eroded
the
most
immediate
fears
that
the
stock
collapse
would
spill
over
into
the
economy
via
a
banking
crisis
for
example
thus
precipitating
recession
it
also
helped
the
dollar
rally
sharply
to
a
high
of
marks
from
a
european
low
of
but
economists
said
today
s
whiplash
moves
do
not
have
long
term
significance
and
that
markets
should
try
to
keep
the
underlying
fundamentals
in
mind
the
united
states
has
been
able
to
live
on
borrowed
time
if
the
effect
of
this
crash
is
to
produce
slower
economic
growth
not
recession
it
contains
good
news
and
provides
a
more
realistic
assessment
of
the
u
s
economy
said
capel
s
dennis
but
he
added
that
markets
are
still
very
much
in
danger
the
liquidity
doesn
t
disappear
all
it
s
doing
is
disappearing
from
the
equity
markets
dennis
noted
david

of

sachs
international
said
world
market
turbulence
will
be
exacerbated
if
the
group
of
seven
g
leading
western
nations
confirms
a
base
for
the

as
implied
by

minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
s
remarks
that
intervention
to
support

is
still
on
last

s
dollar
fall
was
partly
triggered
by
expectations
that
the
germans
were
more
worried
about
the
money
supply
impact
of
such
intervention
than
maintaining
currency
stability
but
rigid
adherence
to
dollar
ranges
would
be
bad
said
morrison
the
louvre
accord
is
fundamentally
misconceived
to
stabilise
the

at

between

in
particular
uncertainty
about

toward
the
u

analysts
said
greenspan
said
today
that
the
dollar
appeared
to
be
nearing
a
bottom
but
the
market
will
bear
in
mind
his
remarks
in
chicago
last

that
the

s
recent
move
upward
was
a
technical
reaction
and
that
it
would
trade
significantly

of

over

vice

carol
mackoff
the
international
community
will
not
like
this
appointment
as
it
suggests
the
possibility
that
the
u
s
budget
deficit
is
too
much
of
a
burden
on
monetary
policy
and
that
volcker
was
unable
to
get
the
commitment
he
sought
to
reduce
the
deficit
added
merrill
lynch
economics
analyst
david
horner
furthermore
that
greenspan
was
not
named
two
months
ago
suggests
that
he
was
not
the
administration
s
first
choice
and
that
the
status
of
his
appointment
was
as
a
bridesmaid
horner
said
a
declining
dollar
scenario
with
higher
currency
futures
prior
to
and
throughout
the
venice
meetings
would
be
mitigated
only
by
concrete
action
as
opposed
to
jawboning
at
the

he
said
but
g

judged
by

may
be
at
an

today
reiterated
that
neither
planned
further

cuts
despite
pressure
from
the

to
do
so
mackoff
said
the
u

on
the
other
hand
has
not
cut
its
budget
deficit
as
japan

west

have
urged
she
said
should
g

force
a
u
s
commitment
to
cut
its

deficit
in
the

a

in

venezuela
s
central
bank
has
ordered
venezuelan
banks
and
exchange
houses
to
cease
foreign
exchange
operations
with
brokers
based
outside
the
country
according
to
a
copy
of
a
central
bank
telex
made
available
to
reuters
the
measure
confirmed
by
a
brokerage
firm
here
has
effectively
cut
off
all
foreign
participation
in
venezuela
s
volatile
currency
market
the
telex
issued
on
may
was
signed
by
carlos
hernandez
delfino
manager
of
the
bank
s
department
of
international
operations
the
telex
said
the
restriction
on
business
with
foreign
brokers
is
in
line
with
an
earlier
measure
prohibiting
foreign
exchange
houses
from
selling
dollars
or
other
foreign
currencies
to
anyone
living
outside
venezuela
in
recent
weeks
the
venezuelan
government
has
denied
rumours
that
it
intends
to
impose
foreign
exchange
controls
to
prop
up
the
weakening
bolivar
but
brokers
said
the
central
bank
s
move
is
seen
as
a
de
facto
currency
control
it
is
definitely
a
control
in
the
sense
that
there
s
no
longer
complete
freedom
to
operate
one
broker
here
said
gradually
they
re
imposing
restrictions
and
the
direction
is
towards
complete
control
the
broker
said
the
broker
who
requested
anonymity
said
virtually
all
his
venezuelan
customers
had
stopped
doing
business
with
him
since
the
central
bank
issued
the
telex
and
followed
it
up
with
telephone
calls
he
said
that
before
the
restriction
was
imposed
the
volume
of
his
firm
s
transactions
with
venezuela
was
about
mln
dlrs
a
day
it
was
a
frenetic
market
it
was
really
quite
active
he
said
the
broker
said
he
saw
no
logical
explanation
for
the
prohibition
because
his
firm
only
acted
act
as
an
intermediary
between
venezuelan
brokers
exchange
houses
and
banks
we
weren
t
buying
dollars
from
venezuelans
that
s
ridiculous
he
said
they
ve
been
on
a
rampage
against
foreigners
the
broker
noted
that
two
months
ago
venezuela
s
central
bank
quietly
announced
that
banks
doing
foreign
exchange
business
outside
venezuela
would
have
to
respect
a
new
pct
reserve
requirement
in
february
the
central
bank
also
prohibited
trading
in
bolivar
futures
the
broker
said
we
used
to
have
a
forward
market
he
said
for
a
small
currency
it
was
miraculous
he
said
the
bolivar
which
averaged
to
the
u
s
dollar
in
would
continue
to
slip
from
its
current
range
of
to
because
the
central
bank
was
rapidly
running
out
of
foreign
reserves
to
support
the

washington
april
west
german
finance
minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
said
today
s
meetings
of
major
industrial
countries
would
look
at
ways
of
strengthening
the
paris
accord
on
stabilizing
foreign
exchange
rates
stoltenberg
told
journalists
he
saw
no
fundamental
weakness
of
the
february
agreement
of
the
group
of
five
countries
and
canada
to
keep
exchange
rates
near
the
then
current
levels
but
he
declined
to
say
what
measures
would
be
discussed
ahead
of
a
communique
of
the
group
of
seven
ministers
later
today
stoltenberg
and
bundesbank
president
karl
otto
poehl
said
the
importance
of
the
paris
agreement
also
known
as
the
louvre
accord
had
been
underestimated
stoltenberg
said
there
is
greater
agreement
now
among
major
countries
than
six
months
ago
at
the
time
of
the
annual
meeting
of
the
international
monetary
fund
and
world
bank
marked
by
sharp
discord
between
the
united
states
and
its
major
trading
partners
there
is
no
fundamental
weakness
of
the
paris
accord
he
said
we
will
be
looking
at
ways
of
strengthening
it
but
i
do
not
want
to
discuss
that
here
stoltenberg
said
the
louvre
agreement
was
working
despite
a
slight
firming
of
the
yen
against
the
dollar
and
poehl
noted
that
the
dollar
mark
parity
was
unchanged
since
february
without
the
bundesbank
having
had
to
sell
marks
to
support
the
dollar
the
louvre
agreement
has
been
honored
by
the
market
he
said
poehl
said
west
germany
had
lived
up
to
its
side
of
the
bargain
in
paris
by
preparing
the
way
for
tax
cuts
to
be
accelerated
as
a
way
of
stimulating
growth
poehl
said
however
that
japan
had
not
yet
fulfilled
its
pledges
for
economic
stimulation
and
we
will
have
to
see
if
the
united
states
is
able
to
do
what
they
promised
in
paris
on
reducing
the
budget
deficit
and
get
it
through
congress
he
added
stoltenberg
reiterated
west
german
concern
about
a
further
fall
in
the
dollar
noting
that
the
mark
was
up
pct
against
the
dollar
and
nearly
pct
on
a
trade
weighted
basis
you
cannot
expect
that
to
go
unnoticed
in
an
economy
and
it
is
not
just
a
german
problem
it
is
a
european

as
had
been

promoting

preventing

from

in
remarks

baker
said
he
was
not
suggesting
that
the

should
be
abandoned

i
do
suggest
he
said
that
we
need
something
to
give
it
more
stability
and
to
keep
it
headed
in
the
right
direction
when
the
wind
shifts
he
said
that
indicators
can
serve
as
a
kind
of
compass
but
added
that
structural
indicators
can
help
focus
attention
on
some
policies
baker
however
said
the
imf
needs
to
move
beyond
macroeconomic
indicators
and
find
structural
indicators
that
can
help
focus
attention
on
some
of
the
policies
of
specific
relevance
to
the
imbalances
we
face
today
the

that

should
be
given
a
more
prominent
role
in

performs
baker
also
told
the
policy
making
group
that
it
was
time
for
the

to
adopt
earlier
recommendations
making
imf
surveillance
more
relevant
to
national
policymakers
and
the
public
in
particular
we
urge
increased
publicity
for
imf
appraisals
developed
in
article
iv

the
use
of
follow
up
reports
on
country
actions
to
implement
imf
recommendations
and
greater
use
of
special
consultation
procedures
he
said
baker
emphasized
that
indicators
were
a
device
for
moving
beyond
rhetoric
to
action
he
said
they
provide
more
structure
to
the
system
and
induce
more
discipline
and
peer
pressure
into
the
process
of
policy
coordination
he
said
the
fund
s
procedures
for
surveillance
need
to
be
reviewed
and
updated
to
reflect
the
use
of
indicators
this
should
be
matter
of
priority
for
the
executive
board
he
said
baker
also
urged
the
fund
to
develop
alternative
medium
term
economic
scenarios
for
countries
that
can
help
us
focus
even
more
clearly
on
the
most
important
imbalances
by
identifying
options
for
addressing
them
and
analyzing
the
implications
of
these
options
he
said
also
that
further
work
should
be
done
on
finding
paths
that
lead
toward
possible
medium
term
objectives
if
we
are
to
take
effective
remedial
action
when
there
are
significant
deviations
from
an
intended
course
then
we
must
have
more
definitive
ways

indentifying

k
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
nigel
lawson
said
the
recent
dispute
between
the
united
states
and
west
germany
over
economic
policy
was
responsible
for
much
financial
turmoil
and
that
it
should
never
have
happened
he
said
in
a
television
interview
the
dispute
had
fanned
fears
of
a
breakdown
in
the
cooperation
which
is
so
important
between
finance
ministers
of
the
major
nations
he
said
the
dispute
was
a
row
which
should
not
have
happened
and
agreed
that
much
of
the
blame
lay
with
u
s
treasury
secretary
james
baker
who
had
publicly
criticised
west
germany
for
having
raised
its
key
interest
rates

the

it
gave
the

late

of
around

bringing
its
total

on

to

this
compares

met

and

president
karl
otto
poehl
in
frankfurt
on
monday
a
bonn
finance
ministry
spokesman
said
after
the
meeting
the
spokesman
quoted
stoltenberg
as
saying
he
was
confident
that
foreign
currencies
could
be
stabilised
at
around
current
levels
the
meeting
came
after
baker
criticised
west
germany
for
increasing
short
term
money
market
interest
rates
he
had
said
the
rise
was
not
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
the
louvre
accord
aimed
at
stabilizing
the
u
s
dollar
last
february
the
meeting
had
been
arranged
last
week
the
spokesman
said
baker
stoltenberg
and
poehl
had
agreed
to
pursue
the
policies
agreed
under
the
louvre
pact
with
reference
to
currency
stability
and
monetary
policy
earlier
on
monday
the
bundesbnak
injected
liquidity
into
the
west
german
money
market
in
a
move
which
money
market
dealers
interpreted
as
an
attempt
by
the
west
german
monetary
authority
to
curb
interest
rate
rises
the
spokesman
described

he
called

oct
the
reserve
bank
of
new
zealand
said
there
was
no
evidence
to
suggest
the
fall
in
share
prices
had
affected
financial
stability
and
it
would
maintain
its
firm
monetary
policy
governor
spencer
russell
said
in
a
statement
the
central
bank
did
not
accept
arguments
that
the
battle
against
inflation
should
now
take
a
low
second
priority
after
the
sharemarket
s
plunge
russell
said
the
bank
had
two
statutory
responsibilities
to
implement
the
government
s
monetary
policy
to
bring
down
inflation
and
to
ensure
the
financial
sector
s
stability
unless
the
bank
is
directed
otherwise
the
firm
monetary
policy
will
continue
because
it
is
very
much
in
the
national
interest
that
it
do
so
he
said
and
there
is
yet
no
evidence
available
to
the
bank
to
suggest
that
the
fall
in
share
prices
has
affected
the
stability

karl
otto
poehl
is
the
scourge
of
speculators
for
bankers
he
is
the
man
who
has
played
a
key
role
in
shaping
the
world
s
financial
destiny
for
the
last
seven
years

the

poehl
is
likely
to
have
his
contract
renewed
for
another
eight
years
when
it
expires
at
the
end
of
this
year
government
officials
say
index
of
economic
spotlights
see
page
ecra
but
no
official
announcement
has
yet
been
made
raising
eyebrows
in
west
germany
s
business
community
the
ebullient
poehl
spent
seven
years
in
bonn
in
top
ministerial
posts
under
the
social
democrats
now
in
opposition
before
he
moved
to
the
bundesbank
there
has
been
speculation
that
chancellor
helmut
kohl
would
try
to
replace
poehl
with
a
man
closer
to
his
own
christian
democrats
but
officials
noted
that
poehl
has
worked
closely
and
successfully
with
finance
minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
since
kohl
s
government
took
office
in
poehl
the
most
senior
central
banker
apart
from
paul
volcker
of
the
united
states
enjoys
a
strong
international
reputation
which
it
would
take
a
newcomer
years
to
build
up
given
these
circumstances
kohl
will
probably
overlook
poehl
s
past
as
an
adviser
to
former
social
democrat
chancellor
willy
brandt
and
top
aide
to
helmut
schmidt
when
he
was
finance
minister
bankers
said
it
was
schmidt
who
as
chancellor
appointed
poehl
to
his
present
job
in
in
recent
months
with
the
mark
s
strong
rise
against
the
dollar
poehl
has
made
exchange
rates
the
central
concern
of
the
bundesbank
s
council
a
highly
conservative
institution
which
has
doggedly
pursued
monetary
policies
to
prevent
inflation
catching
hold
older
germans
can
remember
two
bouts
of
galloping
inflation
this
century
but
with
consumer
prices
falling
for
much
of
and
inflation
negligible
so
far
this
year
poehl
thinks
it
is
safe
to
relax
the
monetary
reins
a
little
and
concentrate
on
the
dangers
to
the
german
economy
of
a
bloated
exchange
rate
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
efforts
to
stabilise
the
dollar
mark
rate
have
reached
a
high
priority
also
for
the
bundesbank
because
a
further
massive
revaluation
of
the
mark
would
endanger
the
economy
in
west
germany
he
told
business
journalists
in
frankfurt
recently
ute
geipel
head
of
research
at
citibank
ag
says
that
poehl
s
reappointment
would
guarantee
flexible
monetary
policy
poehl
s
policy
has
always
been
a
policy
which
does
not
focus
so
rigidly
on
domestic
factors
but
also
on
the
external
economy
she
said
an
economist
at
a
german
bank
who
declined
to
be
identified
said
if
poehl
is
confirmed
in
his
post
it
will
certainly
be
a
plus
for
the
pragmatic
course
which
is
not
so
rigidly
oriented
towards
money
supply
one
of
poehl
s
great
struggles
recently
has
been
to
persuade
the
united
states
to
stop
talking
down
the
dollar
for
poehl
the
significance
of
the
february
louvre
accord
was
that
the
united
states
agreed
to
join
efforts
to
stabilise
currencies
the
louvre
accord
was
greeted
with
scepticism
by
currency
dealers
who
said
they
would
soon
put
it
to
the
test
but
in
fact
the
dollar
has
been
relatively
stable
since
the
pact
this
is
because
the
markets
know
or
perhaps
because
they
don
t
know
what
the
central
banks
can
do
poehl
says
of
intervention
in
currency
markets
which
can
quickly
turn
rates
round
making
a
speculator
s
position
worthless
poehl
was
born
in
and
worked
as
a
financial
journalist
in
the
before
starting
his
ministerial
career
a
relaxed
sun
tanned
figure
who
enjoys
cracking
jokes
over
a
glass
of
beer
he
is
hardly
a
stereotype
central
banker
he
is
also
a
keen
sportsman
who
likes
to
watch
football
and
play
golf
poehl
says
currency
market
intervention
cannot
substitute
for
correct
economic
policies
if
exchange
rates
are
imbalanced
but
you
can
achieve
an
enormous
effect
with
a
small
amount
if
you
strike
at
the
right
moment
he
said
bundesbank
dealers
are
very
professional
and
skilled
they
ve
burnt
the
fingers
of
many
people
he
said
and
unlike
the
speculators
poehl
notes
the
bundesbank
dealers
usually
make
a
profit

paris
oct
the
louvre
accord
on
currency
stability
which
has
maintained
an
uneasy
calm
in
currency
markets
since
last
february
appeared
in
serious
danger
today
as
a
transatlantic
dispute
over
west
german
interest
rates
came
to
the
boil
foreign
exchange
dealers
said
but
as
the
dollar
slid
against
the
mark
and
world
stock
and
bond
markets
plunged
officials
in
the
major
industrial
countries
played
down
the
dispute
as
a
bilateral
problem
between
the
united
states
and
west
germany
and
insisted
that
the
currency
pact
was
still
alive
u
s
treasury
secretary
james
baker
sparked
the
market
fears
when
he
attacked
the
rise
in
west
german
short
term
interest
rates
that
s
not
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
what
we
agreed
to
as
recently
as
earlier
this
month
in
washington
baker
said
in
a
u
s
television
interview
on
sunday
he
was
referring
to
the
meetings
of
finance
ministers
from
the
group
of
seven
leading
industrial
nations
which
reaffirmed
the
pact
under
the
louvre
accord
west
germany
and
japan
who
both
have
large
trade
surpluses
pledged
to
boost
their
economic
growth
to
take
in
more
exports
from
the
u
s
while
the
u
s
agreed
to
stop
talking
the
dollar
down
however
baker
said
on
saturday
that
while
the
louvre
agreement
was
still
operative
the
west
german
interest
rate
move
would
force
the
u
s
to
re
examine
the
accord
the
foreign
exchange
market
has
been
told
by
baker
that
he
s
going
to
hammer
germany
he
has
just
declared
all
bets
are
off
in
terms
of
currency
cooperation
chris
johns
currency
analyst
at
ubs
phillips
and
drew
in
london
said
but
a
bank
of
japan
official
took
a
much
more
sanguine
view
telling
reuters
that
the
exchange
market
is
apparently
reacting
too
much
and
anyone
who
sold
the
dollar
on
the
baker
comment
will
regret
it
later
on
french
finance
minister
edouard
balladur
who
hosted
the
louvre
meeting
was
the
only
one
of
the
finance
ministers
to
respond
directly
to
baker
s
remarks
he
called
for
a
faithful
and
firm
adherence
by
all
the
major
industrial
countries
to
the
louvre
accords
in
both
their
letter
and
spirit
neither
the
west
german
finance
ministry
nor
the
british
treasury
commented
on
the
row
but
a
japanese
finance
ministry
official
said
that
despite
u
s
frustration
over
higher
interest
rates
abroad
this
does
not
represent
its
readiness
to
scrap
the
basic
framework
of
the
louvre
accord
in
frankfurt
f
wilhelm
christians
joint
chief

said
that
following
recent
meetings
with
baker
he
believed
that
the
u

was
still
committed
to
the
accord
in
a
move
which
the
market
interpreted
as
a
possible

london

the
scale
of

intervention
the
bank
of
england
has
carried
out
recently
is
clear
proof
of

s
determination
to
stabilise

agreed
between
the

industrialised
countries
in

in

chancellor

said
saying
he
was
content
with
sterling
s
current
value
lawson
told
reporters
he
wanted
to
maintain
the
exchange
rate
stability
we
have
all
signed
up
for

lawson
said
we
have
been
playing
a
very
full
part
ourselves
in
meeting
our
commitments
toward
exchange
rate
stability
as
agreed
in
paris
we
wish
to
see
it
stability
continuing
he
added
asked
which
techniques
were
available
to
preserve
stability
lawson
said
both
central
bank
intervention
and
interest
rate
changes
could
be
used
to
tackle
the
market
pressures
there
are
from
time
to
time
interest
rate
stability
is
not
an
objective
in
that
sense
rates
have
to
be
moved
up
and
down
at
times
he
added
lawson
said
he
expected
intervention
to
be
sterilised
by
draining
excess
sterling
liquidity
from
the
market
through
new
issues
of
government
securities
and
foreign
currency
sales
when
the
market
allowed
this
would
limit
the
inflationary
impact
of
intervention
he
said
sterilisation
will
be
dictated
by
market
tactics
not
necessarily
in
the
month
in
which
intervention
occurs
lawson
said
i
am
confident
that
we
can
sterilise

this
scale

which
lie
behind

london
economists
said
there
s
going

have
to
be
some
acknowledgement
that
the

is
going
to
be
allowed
to
slip
said
richard
jeffrey
of
hoare
govett
if
not
there
is
going
to
be
continued
fear
that
when
pressure
emerges
on
the
dollar
the
fed
will
be
forced
to
tighten
this
throws
up
the
economic
abyss
of
recession
in
the
u
s
with
obvious
knock
on
effects
on
the
rest
of
the
world
but
some
economists
added
that
wall
street
s
crash
which
dragged
other
major
markets
down
with
it
may
help
curb
the
very
problems
that
sparked
the
turmoil
namely
world
inflation
fears
and
the
massive
and
persistent
u
s
trade
deficits
if
there
is
a
benefit
from
a
pct
fall
in
wall
street
it
s
some
sort
of
resistance
to
inflation
worldwide
said
geoffrey

of

echoing
comments
from

london
and
tokyo
analysts
lower

from
lower

and
fears
of
further

should
dampen
credit
growth
curbing
inflationary
pressures
and
import
demand
in
the
u
s
they
say
such
considerations
may
be
helping
bond
markets
resist
the
equity
crash
according
to
mike
osborne
of
kleinwort
grieveson
it
would
be
suicidal
for
any
government
in
the
context
of
what
happened
in
the
last
couple
of

to
jack
up

and

for

the
news
eroded
the
most
immediate
fears
that
the
stock
collapse
would
spill
over
into
the
economy
via
a
banking
crisis
for
example
thus
precipitating
recession
it
also
helped
the
dollar
rally
sharply
to
a
high
of
marks
from
a
european
low
of
but
economists
said
today
s
whiplash
moves
do
not
have
long
term
significance
and
that
markets
should
try
to
keep
the
underlying
fundamentals
in
mind
the
united
states
has
been
able
to
live
on
borrowed
time
if
the
effect
of
this
crash
is
to
produce
slower
economic
growth
not
recession
it
contains
good
news
and
provides
a
more
realistic
assessment
of
the
u

economy
said
capel

but
he
added
that

are
still
very

in

the

disappearing
from

s
dollar
fall
was
partly
triggered
by
expectations
that
the
germans
were
more
worried
about
the
money
supply
impact
of
such
intervention
than
maintaining
currency
stability
but
rigid
adherence
to
dollar
ranges
would
be
bad
said
morrison
the
louvre
accord
is
fundamentally
misconceived
to
stabilise
the
dollar
at
too
high
a
level
is
wrong

currency
futures
are
likely
to
move
higher
following
the
sharp
rally
today
after
president
reagan
announced
that
paul
volcker
would
not
accept
a
third
term
as
federal
reserve
chairman
and
that
alan
greenspan
was
nominated
as
his
replacement
currency
analysts
said
contrary
to
predictions
before
the
volcker
resignation
analysts
are
calling
for
higher
currency
futures
prices
between
now
and
the
june
venice
economic
summit
in
particular
uncertainty
about
greenspan
s
attitude
to
the
dollar
could
undermine
sentiment
toward
the
u
s
currency
analysts
said
greenspan
said
today
that
the
dollar
appeared
to
be
nearing
a
bottom
but
the
market
will
bear
in
mind
his
remarks
in
chicago
last
week
that
the
dollar
s
recent
move
upward
was
a
technical
reaction
and
that
it
would
trade
significantly
lower
analysts
said
disappointment
of
european
central
bankers
over
the
appointment
will
be
used
as
an
opportunity
to
sell
the
dollar
lower
said
manufacturers
hanover
futures
vice
president
carol
mackoff
the
international
community
will
not
like
this
appointment
as
it
suggests
the
possibility
that
the
u
s
budget
deficit
is
too
much
of
a
burden
on
monetary
policy
and
that
volcker
was
unable
to
get
the
commitment
he
sought
to
reduce
the
deficit
added
merrill
lynch
economics
analyst
david
horner
furthermore
that
greenspan
was
not
named
two
months
ago
suggests
that
he
was
not
the
administration
s
first
choice
and
that
the
status
of
his
appointment
was
as
a
bridesmaid
horner
said
a
declining
dollar
scenario
with
higher
currency
futures
prior
to
and
throughout
the
venice
meetings
would
be
mitigated
only
by
concrete
action
as
opposed
to
jawboning
at
the
g
summit
he
said
but
g
finance
ministers
judged
by
recent
statements
may
be
at
an
impasse
analysts
said
japan
and
west
germany
today
reiterated
that
neither
planned
further
interest
rate
cuts
despite
pressure
from
the
u
s
to
do
so
mackoff
said
the
u
s
on
the
other
hand
has
not
cut
its
budget
deficit
as
japan
and
west
germany
have
urged
she
said
should
g
members
force
a
u
s
commitment
to
cut
its
budget
deficit
in
the
next
two
years
a
further
decline
in
the
dollar
could
be
forestalled
horner
said
however
the
impact
from
venice
will
be
nothing
if
nothing
changes

the

criticised

they

say
the
japanese
the
dominant
foreign
investors
in

securities
have
already
sold
u

but
if
the

which
did
not
happen
yesterday
japanese

will
definitely
try

an

would
also
affect
japanese
investment
in

japan
u
s
interest
rate
differentials
which
currently
look
wide
enough
mean
nothing
in
the
absence
of

stability
said
kawakami
u
s
bonds
could
benefit
due
to
a
gloomy
economic
picture
following
the
estimated
huge
losses
in

by
major
u
s
institutional
and
individual
investors
he
said
the
effect
should
be
to
rule
out
any
u

rate
rise
but
most
japanese
investors
in

are
still
wiating
to
see
if
the

really
is
stable
he
said
the

was
holding
firm
at
above

on
tuesday
morning
although
japanese

sold
huge

in

yesterday
most

hiromitsu

down

the

the

washington

finance
ministers
from
seven
major
industrialized
nations
agreed
on
the
need
to
stabilize
currencies
at
current
levels
but
said
more
action
was
needed
to
reduce
trade
imbalances
and
sustain
economic
growth
in
a
communique
issued
after
a
four
hour
meeting
at
the
u
s
treasury
that
ended
last
night
the
ministers
said
the
value
of
the
dollar
and
other
currencies
was
basically
correct
now
and
they
welcomed
new
measures
planned
by
the
japanese
to
boost
their
economy
west
german
finance
minister
gerhard
stoltenberg
called
it
a
good
meeting
and
in
brief
remarks
exchanged
with
reporters
other
ministers
seemed
pleased
with
its
outcome
shortly
after
the
communique
was
issued
and
just
as
foreign
exchange
trading
opened
in
tokyo
the
bank
of
japan
intervened
again
to
prevent
the
yen
rising
too
quickly
the
communique
said
the
ministers
and
governors
reaffirmed
the
commitment
to
the
cooperative
approach
agreed
at
the
recent
paris
meeting
they
agreed
however
that
further
actions
will
be
essential
to
resist
rising
protectionist
pressures
sustain
global
economic
expansion
and
reduce
trade
imbalances
it
welcomed
the
plans
set
this
week
by
the
japan
s
ruling
liberal
democratic
party
to
stimulate
its
economy
with
what
the
communique
termed
extraordinary
and
urgent
measures
including
an
unprecedented
front

major

the
communique
said
the
ministers
reaffirmed
the
commitment
on
cooperation
reached
in
a
meeting
on
february
in
paris
when
they
had
agreed
to
stabilize
foreign
exchange
rates
at
the
then
current
levels
in
the
weeks
that
followed
the
dollar
continued
to
fall
against
the
japanese
yen
despite
massive
dollar
purchases
by
the
bank
of
japan
and
other
central
banks
and
is
now
trading
at
around
postwar
lows
japan
has
come
under
growing
criticism
from
both
the
united
states
and
european
countries
for
its
only
modest
efforts
to
open
its
markets
to
outside
competition
and
to
reduce
its
exports
the
communique
said
japan
affirmed
its
intention
to
open
domestic
markets
to
foreign
goods
and
services
but
did
not
elaborate
it
said
the
officials
reaffirmed
the
view
that
around
current
levels
their
currencies
are
within
ranges
broadly
consistent
with
economic
fundamentals

the
basic
policy

west

declined
to
comment
on
whether
unpublished
target
zones
for
currencies
agreed
at
last
february
s
louvre
accord
had
been
changed
as
a
result
of
the
meeting
on
monday
with
u
s
treasury
secretary
james

he
was
asked
about
target
zones
at

in

stoltenberg
referred
to
a
statement
released
after
monday
s
meeting
which
said
continuing
cooperation
was
aimed
at
promoting
currency
stability
at
current
levels
this
was
the
same
formula
used
in

text
of

louvre
accord

noted

says
louvre
currency
accord
satisfactory
london
june
the
louvre
agreement
by
the
group
of
seven
finance
ministers
and
central
bankers
to
stabilise
currencies
has
worked
well
and
needs
no
fundamental
strengthening
at
the
economic
summit
in
venice
on
june
u
k
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
nigel
lawson
said
previewing
the
summit
which
he
expected
would
not
produce
any
major
new
economic
initiatives
lawson
told
reporters
work
remained
to
be
done
on
improving
the
conditions
for
lasting
world
economic
growth


side
measures
to
boost
growth
he
said
i
think
it
is
possible
that
there
may
be
scope
for
a
further
reduction
in
interest
rates
in
germany
he
added
but
stressed
that
he
had
had
no
indication
that
such
a
move
was
likely
he
made
no
mention
of
japanese
interest
rates
lawson
said
the
u
s
should
embark
on
a
gradual
reduction
of
its
fiscal
deficits
over
the
next
two
or
three
years
he
said
the
february
louvre
accord
had
produced
satisfactory
exchange
rate
stability
in
part
thanks
to
heavy
coordinated
intervention
of
group
of
seven
central
banks
and
he
was
content
with
sterling
s
exchange
rate
pointing
to
the
record
billion
stg
rise
in
u
k
may
currency
reserves
announced
today
he
said
we
have
been
playing
a
very
full
part
ourselves
we
have
been
intervening
to
a
very
much
greater
extent
than
we
had
done
hitherto
lawson
said
there
was
a
risk
that
the
louvre
agreement
may
falter
if
member
states
did
not
implement
the
macro
economic
commitments
underlying
the
accord
certainly
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
maintain
exchange
rate
stability
if
countries
are
seen
not
to
implement
their
commitments
in
paris
in
this
respect
he
said
the
u
s
budget
deficit
was
very
important
noting
the
billion
yen
economic
package
announced
by
japanese
prime
minister
yasuhiro
nakasone
last
week
lawson
said
what
is
really
needed
in
japan
is
an
increase
in
merchandise
imports
supply
side
measures
are
critical
there
is
a
specific
range
of
consumer
and
agricultural
goods
where
they
have
an
extremely
restrictive
regime
which
is
wholly
unjustified
he
said
lawson
doubted
that
tokyo
s
partners
would
indulge
in
japan
bashing
at
the
summit
especially
after
the
economic
stimulation
package
and
the
announcement
of
nakasone
s
plans
to
increase
japanese
development
aid
over
the
next
three
years
japan
s
more
flexible
stance
on
tokyo
stock
exchange
membership
would
also
help
deflect
criticism
he
said
he
said
he
thought
west
germany
would
instead
come
under
pressure
at
the
summit
to
adopt
similar
stimulation
measures
to
jack
up
faltering
economic
growth
in
this
respect
lawson
said
he
hoped
bonn
would
bring
forward
to
january
part
of
its
agreed
package
of
tax
cuts
scheduled
for
he
also
called
on
bonn
to
push
ahead
with
the
privatisation
of
german
national
industries
on
debt
lawson
said
he
expected
a
three
point
british
plan
to
alleviate
the
burden
of
the
poorest
sub
saharan
countries
to
make
progress
in
venice
the
plan
involving
concessional
rescheduling
of
sovereign
debt
in
the
paris
club
was
first
proposed
at
the
imf
and
world
bank
meetings
in
washington
earlier
this
year
lawson
said
he
would
seek
to
consolidate
political
backing
for
the
plan
at
the
venice
summit
and
hoped
the
programme
would
be
finalised
at
the
autumn
meetings
of
the
imf
and
world
bank
he
welcomed
the
recent
moves
by
citicorp
and
chase
manhattan
to
increase
sharply
their
third
world
debt
provisions
first
it
is
a
blow
for
realism
second
because
the
market
response
has
shown
that
banks
have
much
less
to
fear
from
this
sort
of
move
than
they
felt
before
citicorp
he
said
u
k
banks
should
follow
bank
of
england
recommendations
strengthening
their
balance
sheets
and
making
more
provisions
they
have
done
it
to
some
extent
they
need
to
do
it
more
lawson
said
adding
it
was
up
to
the
banks
themselves
to
determine
the
appropriate
size
of
provisions
he
also
said
the
dismantling
of
farm
subsidies
would
be
discussed
at
the
summit
there
is
a
consensus
which
we
have
to
push
further
g
wants
to
show

its
resolve
miyazawa
washington
april
japanese
finance
minister
kiichi
miyazawa
said
the
group
of
seven
g
countries
reaffirmed
their
paris
accord
on
stabilising
currencies
to
convince
the
market
of
their
resolve
at
a
news
conference
after
today
s
g
meeting
miyazawa
said
the
ministers
and
central
bank
governors
did
not
believe
a
totally
new
statement
was
needed
the
speculative
selling
did
not
reflect
economic
fundamentals
and
since
the
fundamentals
had
not
changed
only
a
reaffirmation
of
the
goals
of
the
paris
accord
was
needed
he
said
he
also
noted
that
this
test
of
the
g
nations
resolve
had
concentrated
on
the
yen
while
other
currencies
especially
the
mark
had
remained
stable
miyazawa
said
any
change
in
economic
conditions
since
the
paris
accord
was
not
worth
being
called
fundamental
as
i
said
at
a
time
of
louvre
agreement
the
expression
of
current
level
is
rather
vague
idea
he
said
the
yen
s
movement
in
the
past
several
weeks
is
within
the
range
agreed
in
paris
in
febraury
he
said
it
was
better
to
give
a
vague
expression
than
pin
pointing
a
level
which
could
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
market
miyazawa
said
asked
why
only
japan
was
committed
to
fresh
measures
in
the
statement
he
said
japan
was
exceptional
among
the
seven
because
the
yen
appreciated
against
the
dollar
while
other
major
currencies
largely
have
been
stable
he
also
said
japan
s
ruling
liberal
democratic
party
has
justed
adoped
a
package
to
reflate
the
economy
while
other
nations
are
not
supposed
to
produce
new
measures
in
a
short
period
since
the
paris
agreement
miyazawa
also
said
the
u
s
sanctions
against
japanese
semiconductor
products
was
not
discussed
through
the
g
meeting
and
did
not
affect
the
currency
talks
the
seven
nations
discussed
the
debt
problems
of
developing
countries
and
ways
to
proceed
in
line
with
the
debt
initiative
outlined
by
u

taiwan

central

announced
that
as
from
today
the
overseas
foreign
exchange
borrowings
of
local
and
foreign

would
be
frozen
at
the
level
they
reached

the
central

s
statement
added
that
the
measure
would
be
effective
until
the
end
of

bankers
said
the
measure
is
designed
to
curb
the
inflow
of

and
slow
the
growth
of
money
supply
they
added
that
the
move
which
sparked
a
record
single

plunge
of
the
local
stock
market
would
limit
their
ability
to
lend
