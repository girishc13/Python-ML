washington
june
the

has
completed

of

practices
but
has
not
yet
decided
whether

levied

last

u

said
they
said
the

looked
at
japan

adherence
to
the
u

yesterday
and
that
an
announcement
may
be
made
shortly
but
there
was
no

what
the

might

officials
have
said
the

on

of

exports
could
be
modified
if
japan
was
found
to
be
honoring
a
portion
of
its

but
they
also
noted
that
the

has
said
it
was
unlikely
the

would
be
lifted
before
the

of
the

in

on

the
officials
added
that
while
the

complicated

japanese
economic
cooperation
they
did
serve
to
blunt
congressional
criticism
that
the
reagan
administrtation
was
not
taking
tough
actions
to
reduce
he
u
s
trade
deficit
reagan
imposed
the

on

in
retaliation
for
japan
s
failure
to
honor

to

at
less

to

washington
however

of

he

that

economists
emphasized
that

not
revising

by

but
simply
presenting
the

on

a

in

caused
a

in

today
because
it
gave
the

dealers
said
that

the

would

changed

permit
it

both

my
feeling
is
the

is
a

there
s
legislation
that
requires
us
to
delay
it
two

said
robert

commerce
undersecretary
for

but
this
has
been
going
on

no

the

figure
excluding

was
passed
in
reportedly
the
feeling
was
the

which
includes

freight

allowed
a
better
comparison
with

taiwan
introduced
a
sweeping

cut
on
some
foreign

last

aimed
at
helping
reduce
its
growing
trade
surplus
with
the
united

the
island
s
largest
trading
partner
washington
however
was
not
satisfied
with
the
cuts
and
pressed
for
more
reductions
as
a
way
of
cutting
its
huge
trade
deficit
with

told

last

he
was
leaving

a
heavy
heart
meaning
that

would
face
tough

in
washington
because
of
rising

sentiments
in

taiwan

was
the

after

washington

secretary
richard
lyng
said
the
united

will
continue
its
policy
of
subsidizing
farm
exports
to
regain
lost
markets
until
there
is
a
global
agreement
to
end
such
subsidies
in
an
interview
with
reuters
lyng
also
acknowledged
he
was
troubled
by
the
prospect
that
the
export
enhancement
program
eep
could
prove
so
indispensable
to
boosting
u
s
exports
that
the
u
s
would
have
difficulty
abandoning
it
yes
i
m
troubled
with
that
a
little
bit
he
said
there
s
no
question
about
it
the
longer
you
feed
the
calf
on
the
cow
the
longer
it
is
to
wean
it
in
recent
months
usda
has
offered
subsidies
on
a
growing
list
of
commodities
to
an
increasing
number
of
countries
lyng
called
u
s
and
european
community
export
subsidies
just
plain
nonsensical
as
a
long
term
policy
and
said
he
saw
an
end
to
the
expansion
of
the
eep
i
m
sure
there
s
an
end
to
the
expansion
but
we
are
doing
this
to
accomplish
our
goal
which
is
to
regain
the
markets
that
we
ve
lost
to
keep
our
products
competitive
and
to
let
those
particularly
the
european
community
who
we
are
convinced
are
the
worst
offenders
in
terms
of
the
export
subsidization
that
we
are
prepared
to
continue
to
do
this
until
we
can
come
to
some
agreement
to
put
an
end
to
it

japanese

minister
kiichi
miyazawa
told
a
press
conference
he
expects
the
u

trade
deficit
to
eventually
start
reflecting
economic
fundamentals
which
should
influence
exchange
rates
the
minister
was
not
referring
to
the
u
s
trade
data
to
be
released
in
washington
later
today
miyazawa
also
said
he
told
major
industrial
nations
when
he
was
in
washington
last
week
that
present
exchange
rates
are
not
necessarily
good
he
had
said
earlier
in

that
current
exchange
rates
were
within

in
the

accord
u
s
canada
ties
seen
worse
without

washington
june
u
s
canadian
ties
could
worsen
if
the
two
nations
are
unable
to
reach
a
free
trade
pact
according
to
a
study
published
by
two
nonpartisan
public
policy
research
groups
the
cato
institute
of
washington
and
the
fraser
institute
of
vancouver
said
removing
the
remaining
tariffs
on
cross
border
trade
would
benefit
both
countries
but
cato
chairman
william
niskanen
added
the
two
nations
generally
harmonious
trade
relations
are
probably
not
sustainable
without
a
new
agreement
the
united
states
and
canada
whose
cross
border
trade
totaled
about
billion
dlrs
last
year
have
been
holding
talks
since
last
june
on
a
pact
to
end
the
few
trade
barriers
remaining
between
their
two
countries
the
u
s
put
a
deadline
on
the
talks
of
october
but
both
sides
have
said
an
agreement
is
likely
despite
tough
bargaining
remained
niskanen
said
if
no
pact
is
reached
bilateral
trade
ties
could
deteriorate
because
of
congressional
pressure
on
president
reagan
to
implement
trade
laws
more
aggressively
and
this
could
hit
some
canadian
trade
practices
he
noted
canada
is
seeking
foreign
investment
in
its
auto
industry
which
could
put
strains
on
the
considerable
bilateral
free
trade
in
u
s
and
canadian
autos
and
parts
niskanen
also
said
the
canadian
government
is
vulnerable
to
a
resurgence
of
economic
nationalism
which
could
restrict
u
s
exports
to
canada
a
free
trade
pact
backed
by
president
reagan
and
prime
minister
brian
mulroney
would
open
new
markets
for
canada
and
enable
its
industries
to
achieve
economies
of
scale
which
would
also
help
it
widen
exports
worldwide
he
said
it
would
also
increase
the
gross
national
products
of
both
countries
niskanen
said
the
goal
of
a
pact
should
be
to
end
all
tariffs
within
years
lower
subsidies
on
exports
set
rules
for

us
says
canadian
israeli
pacts
should
spur

washington
oct
trade
representative
clayton
yeutter
said
on
monday
that
the
u
s
free
trade
agreements
with
canada
and
israel
should
help
to
pave
the
way
for
liberalizing
the
global
trading
system
he
said
the
canadian
and
israeli
pacts
will
not
set
back
worldwide
reform
efforts
under
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
gatt
as
some
critics
feared
but
help
them
the
gatt
talks
began
a
year
ago
in
punta
del
este
uruguay
to
liberalize
the
global
trading
system
and
to
include
in
it
trade
in
agriculture
and
services
such
as
banking
yeutter
made
his
remarks
at
a
u
s
israeli
trade
meeting
marking
the
second
year
of
their
bilateral
accord
the
canadian
u
s
pact
signed
by
two
sides
two
weeks
ago
has
yet
been
approved
by
the
u
s
congress
and
canadian
parliament
the
two
free
trade
agreements
fta
would
gradually
remove
tariffs
and
other
barriers
to
cross
border
trade
in
goods
and
many
services
yeutter
said
in
the
aftermath
of
the
canadian
and
israeli
pacts
other
countries
have
realized
that
if
they
want
to
continue
to
have
access
to
the
world
s
largest
market
they
had
better
get
serious
about
improving
the
gatt
the
pact
with
israel
he
said
is
gradually
increasing
shipments
both
ways
and
the
canadian
pact
will
substantially
increase
the
gross
national
products
in
both
countries
yeutter
also
said
the
canadian
and
israeli
pacts
should
serve
as
important
precedents
for
progress
in
gatt
yeutter
said
increasing
trade
is
one
of
the
keys
to
enhanced
political
and
economic
stability
around
the
globe
he
said
a
stronger
gatt
will
enhance
prosperity
not
only
for
advanced
industrial
nations
but
also
for
other
countries
that
need
to
increase
trade
in
order
to
better
their
standards
of
living
yeutter
added
it
was
important
not
to
risk
the
progress
made
in
the
israeli
and
canadian
trade
pacts
by
resorting
to
protectionism
he
was
referring
to
trade
legislation
pending
in
congress
that
would
force
the
united
states
to
take
retaliatory
actions
against
nations
with
large
trade
surpluses
with
the
united
states
if
the
countries
practiced
unfair
trade
the
legislation
was
prompted
by
a
growing
u
s
trade
deficit
that
hit
billion
dlrs
last
year
and
is
still
rising
yeutter
said
the
pressures
for
congress
to
act
were
hard
to
resist
but
the
pending
legislation
would
undermine
president
reagan
s
efforts
to
liberalize
the
world
trade
yeutter
renewed
the
threat
of
a
white
house
veto
he
said
president
reagan
will
veto
any
bill
that
contains
serious
flaws
and
i
believe
that
veto
would
be
sustained
shultz
welcomes
tokyo
economic
package
rome
june
u
s
secretary
of
state
george
shultz
said
the
billion
yen
economic
package
announced
by
tokyo
last
week
went
further
than
the
u
s
had
expected
but
he
said
the
u
s
would
not
lift
the
selective
economic
sanctions
it
imposed
on
japanese
imports
in
april
until
tokyo
changed
its
sales
policies
concerning
computer
microchips
speaking
in
a
televised
news
conference
linking
several
european
capitals
shultz
said
it
was
heartening
that
the
japanese
had
confronted
the
problem
of
stimulating
domestic
and
global
demand
there
is
an
even
greater
amount
of
stimulus
than
was
originally
thought
said
shultz
speaking
from
washington
it
is
a
lot
more
than
nothing
it
is
more
than
was
talked
about
when
prime
minister
yasuhiro
nakasone
was
here
it
involves
a
major
reduction
in
tax
rates
and
we
believe
that
getting
the
tax
burden
down
is
one
way
of
stimulating
the
economy
he
added
but
asked
by
japanese
reporters
also
linked
into
the
news
conference
whether
the
positive
reaction
meant
the
u
s
might
decide
at
next
week
s
venice
summit
to
lift
its
sanctions
on
some
japanese
electronic
goods
shultz
replied
these
sanctions
were
undertaken
on
the
basis
of
an
agreement
that
had
been
reached
between
the
united
states
and
japan
on
various
sale
practices
and
prices
relating
to
the
chip
market
they
will
be
lifted
as
the
facts
of
change
by
japan
to
the
agreement
that
it
made
become
evident
he
said
u
s
officials
had
only
been
able
to
monitor
the
situation
for
a
month
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
a
trend
on
only
one
month
s
data
the
u
s
imposed
pct
import
duties
on
personal
computers
colour
televisions
and
power
tools
alleging
that
japan
had
violated
last
september
s
bilateral
agreement
by
selling
computer
chips
at
below
fair
market
value
shultz
said
west
germany
and
other
nations
would
also
do
well
to
look
at
what
they
could
do
to
stimulate
demand
asked
whether
the
u
s
could
reasonably
ask
its
allies
to
take
action
to
stimulate
the
world
economy
without
a
bold
american
initiative
to
reduce
the
size
of
the
federal
budget
deficit
shultz
said
moves
were
already
underway
to
tackle
the
problem
he
said
by
the
end
of
the
current
fiscal
year
the
deficit
would
probably
be
reduced
by
around
billion
dlrs
against
last
year
and
that
the

being
worked
on
this

would
contain

the

itself
has
switched
its
tactics
in

substituting
general
calls
for
action
by
japan
to
open
its

with
specific
demands
for
moves
in
key
areas
at
present
it
is
for
instance
pressuring
japan
to
end
allegedly
discriminatory
taxation
of
imported
wines
and
spirits
to
ensure
ec
companies
have
a
chance
to
win

for
the
building
of
a
new
international
airport
and
to
simplify
certification
and
safety
checks
on
imported
cars
ec
officials
say
these
tactics
yield
some
benefits
but
often
the
japanese
announce
modifications
of
their
non

barriers
which
open
the
door
to

called

to

in

opposition
because
of
the

house
statement
said
reagan
s
decision
to
press
for
continuation
of
so
called
most
favored
nation
mfn
status
for
romania
had
been
exceptionally
difficult
and
came
after
all
options
were
seriously
considered
but
the
statement
said
that
despite
concerns
about
human
rights
abuses
by
the
bucharest
government
the
president
had
decided
that
should
be
continued
because
it
helped
stimulate
emigration
from
romania
and
gave
the
united
states
influence
on
human
rights
practices
there
the
statement
was
issued
as
reagan
sent
to

requests
for
one

for

attached

for

certification
by

washington
june
the
use
of
tariffs
and

to
reduce
the
flow
of
foreign
goods
into
the

will
do
little
to
cut
the
nation
s
swelling
trade
deficit
a
government
study
said
in
fact
the
federal
trade
commission
ftc
report
said
such
protectionist
policies
could
make
u
s
products
less
competitive
in
the
world
marketplace
by
raising
the
cost
of
imported
products
that
are
re
exported
in
different
forms
such
policies
are
much
more
likely
to
hurt
rather
than
help
the
productive
capabilities
of
the
u
s
economy
it
said
the
page
report
written
by
ftc
economists
john
hilke
and
philip
nelson
blamed
the
rising
trade
shortfall
which
climbed
to
a
record
billion
dlrs
last
year
on
shifting
currency
exchange
rates
and
growing
u
s
consumer
demand
other
factors
commonly
blamed
for
the
deficit
such
as
foreign
trade
practices
deteriorating
u
s
industrial
competitiveness
high
labour
costs
and
government
restrictions
on
mergers
added
little
to
the
problem
it
said
although
each
industry
s
competitiveness
affects
the
level
of
imports
and
exports
in
that
industry
in
general
we
find
that
there
have
been
no
significant
industry
specific
changes
affecting
competitiveness
that
would
explain
the
increase
in
the
overall
trade
deficit
the
study
said
to
the
extent
any
government
action
is
needed
to
deal
with
the
trade
deficits
policies
should
focus
on
economy
wide
phenomena
such
as
exchange
rates
and
relative
economic
growth
the
ftc
study
said
supporting
its
conclusion
that
broad
based
economic
shifts
were
the
cause
of
the
increase
in
the
trade
deficit
the
report
said
it
found
that
nearly
all
u
s
industries
lost
some
domestic
market
share
to
foreign
competitors
in
the
it
also
said
it
found
a
fairly
direct
relationship
between
the
increased
trade
deficit
and
the
influence
of
shifting
currency
exchange
rates
u
s
economic
growth
and
domestic
demand
for
goods
and
services
which
has
outpaced
foreign
consumer
demand
the
study
examined
seven
factors
which
have
been
commonly
blamed
for
the
trade
deficit
foreign
government
subsidies
and
trade
barriers
to
protect
foreign
industries

lack
of
investment
in
u

the
oil

rises
of

trim
next

federal
budget
deficit
but
believe
the
actions
will
do
little
to
help
improve
the
u
s
trade
deficit
or
buoy
the
economy
the
house
of
representatives
is
expected
to
vote
tomorrow
to
approve
a
trillion
dollar
budget
blueprint
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
that
reduces
the
deficit
by
billion
dlrs
similarly
the
senate
budget
committee
has
approved
a
plan
that
would
cut
federal
red
ink
by
about
billion
dlrs
next
year
in
terms
of
the
economy
billion
dlrs
is
infinitesimal
so
cuts
of
this
magnitude
will
have
little
impact
on
the
economy
and
the
trade
deficit
said
stanley
collander
a
touche

federal

policy
analyst
at
best
it
will
have
a
small
positive
effect
collander
said
in
an
interview
federal
reserve
board
chairman
paul
volcker
has
repeatedly
told
congress
that
cutting
federal
red
ink
would
go
a
long
way
to
help
reduce
the
massive
trade
deficit
and
also
help
ease
some
of
the
downward
pressure
on
the
value
of
the
dollar
the
u
s
government
has
attempted
to
remedy
the
trade
imbalance
by
driving
down
the
value
of
the
dollar
but
volcker
has
warned
that
a
further
fall
in
the
dollar
s
value
is
fraught
with
danger
such
a
decline
he
has
said
could
refuel
inflation
as
imported
goods
become
more
expensive
and
chase
away
foreign
capital
needed
to
finance
the
federal
budget
deficit
in
addition
in
february
u
s
officials
meeting
with
other
major
industrialized
nations
in
paris
agreed
that
the
value
of
the
dollar
had
dropped
enough
and
that
world
exchange
rates
should
be
stabilized
at
around
current
levels
as
part
of
that
agreement
japan
and
west
germany
agreed
to
take
steps
to
stimulate
their
economies
and
the
united
states
agreed
to
cut
its
budget
deficit
the
alternative
to
driving
down
the
dollar
any
further
as
a
way
to
deal
with
the
trade
deficit
volcker
said
recently
is
to
reduce
u
s
consumption
particularly
federal
spending
if
you
don
t
deal
with
the
budget
deficit
everything
else
you
do
is
going
to
be
counterproductive
volcker
said
in
recent
testimony
before
the
senate
banking
committee
volcker
also
said
he
would
prefer
to
further
tighten
the
government
s
purse
strings
than
have
the
fed
tighten
the
credit
supply
if
action
was
needed
to
fight
inflationary
pressures
or
to
assure
the
continued
flow
of
foreign
capital
into
the
united
states
analysts
say
that
fed
tightening
now
could
choke
off
the
current
modest
economic
expansion
and
threaten
a
recession
kemper
financial
services
economist
john
silvia
stressed
that
any
deficit
reduction
was
better
than
none
but
he
said
the
size
of
the
cuts
under
consideration
were
not
enough
to
give
the
federal
reserve
board
the
flexibility
it
needs
to
steer
the
economy
or
to
keep
the
value
of
the
dollar
from
plunging
further
in
world
exchange
markets
there
s
no
doubt
that
some
deficit
reduction
helps
but
if
your
objective
is
to
stabilize
the
dollar
and
perserve
the
fed
s
flexibility
to
conduct
monetary
policy
then
the
answer
is
it
s
not
enough
silvia
told
reuters
the
u
s
trade
deficit
has
become
one
of
the
government
s
most
vexing
and
persistent
problems
the
deficit
was
billion
dlrs
and
there
is
as
yet
little
indication
that
this
year
s
figure
will
be
any
lower
though
administration
officials
have
predicted
it
will
drop
by
about
to
billion
dlrs
by
year
s
end
in
the
past
volcker
has
joked
that
he
never
lost
sleep
worrying
whether
congress
would
cut
too
much
fat
from
the
federal
budget
on
the
other
hand
he
also
has
made
it
clear
he
is
not
attached
to
the
gradually
declining
deficit
ceilings
set
for
the
period
by
last
year
s
gramm
rudman
balanced
budget
law
while
the
new
law
set
a
ceiling
of
billion
dlrs
for
next
year
s
federal
deficit
both
the
house
and
senate
budget
committees
have
conceded
that
their
budget
plans
would
fall
short
of
the
deficit
reduction
goal
by
about
billion
dlrs
for
political
reasons
to
billion
dlrs
is
about
the
most
you
re
going
to
get
out
of
congress
at
the
present
time
said
touche
ross
s
collander
to
do
something
more
than
that
would
be
extraordinary
remarkable
and
very
very
difficult
collander
said
the
real
danger
for
congress
was
to
end
up
short
of
the
deficit
reduction
goal
set
by
its
budget
panels
to
an
extent
this
has
become
the
minimum
acceptable
reduction
level
he
explained
anything
less
than
that
will
now
look
like
a
failure
to
wall
street
the
budget
plan
now
under
debate
on
the
house
floor
would
lower
an
estimated
billion
dlr
deficit
for
the
year
beginning
on
october
one
to
about
billion
dlrs
by
cutting
defense
and
domestic
programs
by
billion
dlrs
from
their
anticipated
spending
levels
for
next
year
the
senate
budget
committee
has
called
for
a
deficit
of
nearly
billion
dlrs
with
about
billion
dlrs
in
new
taxes
and
about
the
same
amount
in

singapore
june
secretary
of
state
george
shultz
said
the
u
s
would
erase
its
large
foreign
trade
deficit
faster
than
many
predicted
and
the
consequences
for
its
trade
partners
might
be
traumatic
the
u
s
economy
will
inevitably
make
the
adjustment
necessary
to
move
from
a
deficit
to
a
surplus
trade
balance
in
order
to
service
our
growing
foreign
debt
he
told
a
conference
attended
by
the
six
members
of
the
association
of
southeast
asian
nations
and
their
leading
western
friends
in
my
view
this
will
happen
more
rapidly
than
many
observers
now
predict
the
universal
strategy
of
aggressive
export
led
growth
is
becoming
less
effective
shultz
said
it
is
not
arithmetically
possible
for
every
country
in
the
world
to
be
a
net
exporter
at
the
same
time
the
u
s
deficit
which
we
all
decry
has
been
in
a
sense
the
place
into
which
everyone
s
export
led
strategy
for
growth
has
gone
the
huge
surpluses
of
japan
and
west
germany
have
fed
on
this
deficit
so
something
will
have
to
give
and
it
will
be
possibly
a
traumatic
experience
he
added
while
you
must
keep
up
the
pressure
on
us
to
eschew
protectionist
policies
you
must
act
too
shultz
said
i
can
do
a
better
job
of
convincing
the
congress
to
leave
our
door
open
to
imports
if
more
of
our
trading
partners
open
their
doors
wider

sure
that

yeutter
told

japan
has
far
too
much
at
stake
in
this
relationship
with
the
united

to
seriously
entertain
thoughts
of

yeutter
said
earlier
today
reagan
imposed

tariffs
on
a

of
japanese
goods
in
retaliation
for
japan
s
alleged
violation
of
a

governing

yeutter
did
say
that
u
s
farm
products
would
be
targeted
if
tokyo
decided
to
hit
back
if
they
japan
were
to
retaliate
it
would
probably
be
on
something
like
american
agricultural

he
said

really

the

happening
are

london
june
britain
s
defence
minister
george
younger
said
the
u
s
was
unfairly
protecting
its
defence
industry
and
this
could
lead
to
british
firms
demanding
counter
measures
younger
told
a
u
s
chamber
of
commerce
meeting
that
u
s
legislators
were
failing
to
realise
the
true
nature
of
the
two
way
street
in
terms
of
ideas
technology
and
equipment
a
british
parliamentary
report
said
that
up
to
march
british
firms
had
been
awarded
just
mln
dlrs
worth
of
contracts
for
the
strategic
defence
initiative
compared
with
the
billion
dlrs
britain
had
hoped
to
secure
the
committee
said
u
s
technology
export
restrictions
and
selectiveness
towards
foreign
contractors
had
denied
british
competitors
more
lucrative
orders
and
largely
excluded
them
from

research
for
sdi
younger
said
london
had
given
u
s
companies
contracts
under
conditions
of
fair
and
open
competition
all
we
ask
is
for
our
companies
to
be
given
similar
opportunities
he
added
if
new
american
legislation
aimed
at
curbing
unfair
subsidies
was
used
to
exclude
foreign
suppliers
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
british

washington
june
with

analysts
from
two
congressional
agencies
said
today
the
office
of

a
nonpartisan

told
a

means
trade
subcommittee
hearing
there
was
still
concern
for
the
future
of
parts
of
the
u
s
textile
and
apparel
industry
but
there
was
more
reason
for
optimism
than
a
few
years
ago
while
textile
producers
are
making
significant
investments
they
could
do
more
ota
analyst
henry
kelly
said
the
congressional
budget
office
cbo
the
nonpartisan
budget
analysis
arm
of
congress
said
federal
loans
or
loan
guarantees
would
be
preferable
options
for
congress
rather
than
increased
trade
protection
which
could
lead
to
foreign
retaliation
cbo
analyst
edward
gramlich
said
past
trade
protections
first
imposed
in
the
s
have
had
only
a
small
benefit
for
profits
and
investments
of
domestic
firms
trade
subcommittee
chairman
rep
sam
gibbons
said
the
agencies
analyses
seemed
to
agree
with
his
opinion
against
congressional
approval
of
protectionist
textile
quota
legislation
aimed
mainly
at
western
europe
japan
and
other
asian
textile
producing
countries
president
reagan
last
year
vetoed
a
textile
protection
bill
but
it
was
reintroduced
in
this
session
of
congress
and
is
expected
to
be
voted
on
in
the
house
this
year
however
approval
this
year
is
in
doubt
because
passage
of
a
major
trade
bill
without
specific
protections
for
textiles
showed
a
weakening
of
support
for
the
legislation
most
u
s
producers
have
fallen
behind
other
foreign
producers
in
the
use
of
modern
textile
and
apparel
production
equipment
and
net
imports
are
growing
faster
than
the
domestic
markets
kelly
said
he
added
that
private
investment
in
the
textile
and
clothing
industry
in
of
pct
was
less
than
one
seventh
the
average
manufacturing
investment
of
pct
despite
existing
import
quotas
and
tariffs
imports
of
textiles
grew
pct
in
and
imports
of
apparel
grew
pct
while
u
s
production
rose
only
pct
the
traditional
industry
seems
destined
to
be
replaced
by
new
technology
imports
or
some
combination
of
both
while
the
industry
may
not
be
able
to
compete
in
all
domestic
markets
that
it
enjoyed
twenty
years
ago
the
results
of
our
research
indicate
that
portions
of
the
domestic
market
can
be
recovered
and
that
exports
can
be
expanded

he

open
about

i
delivered
it
very
clearly
and
it
has
been
clearly
understood
howard
said
that
under

financial
services
act
the
govenment
had
considerable
flexibility
in
taking
sanctions
against
japanese
companies
and
finance
houses
operating
in
britain
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
withdrawing

refusing
operating
licences
we
can
ban
firms
from
certain
countries
from
carrying
out
certain
kinds
of
business
while
allowing
them
to
carry
out
other
kinds
i
hope
we
don
t
have
to
use
these
powers
but
i
made
it
clear
in
japan
that
if
our
timetable
isn
t
met
we
shall
use
them
he
said
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
britain
and
japan
became
involved
in

tit
for

exchange
adding
that
japan
gained
more
than
anyone
else
from
an
open
trading
relationship
i
think
they
are
beginning
to
appreciate
that
if
this
relationship
is
to
continue
it
is
very
important
for
them
to
be
fair
and
open
about
access
to
their

that

the

asked

to
replace

schedule
with
a
new
system
to
bring
it
into
line
with
international
tariff
categories
u
s
trade
representative
clayton
yeutter
said
the
new
system
will
add
such
items
as
fiber
optics
and
more
accurately
define
new
composites
items
not
widely
traded
when
the
current
schedule
was
devised
some
years
ago
yeutter
said
the
harmonized
system
as
the
new
schedule
is
called
will
change
tariff
categories
and
definitions
to
meet
the
present
day
needs
of
exporters
and
importers
but
they
should
pay
about
the
same
rates
of
duties

american
exporters
will
find
it

easier

deal
with

the

the

moves

commerce

said
the

were
aimed
at
encouraging
export
oriented
industries
to
boost
foreign
exchange
earnings
and
imports
of
essential
machinery
and
raw
materials
to
increase
industrial
production
the

was
easing

both

in

said
ending

on

feared

in

bangladesh

fell
to

munim
said

and
open
its

could
persuade
the
u

not

said
and
replied
it
is
probably
too
early
for
the
figures
to
demonstrate
that
the
situation
has
turned
around
and
to
permit
the
result
you
have
described
armacost
said
the
u
s
hopes
japan
will
take
steps
to
lift
its
domestic
economy
and
reduce
dependence
on
exports
remove
barriers
to
imports
and
settle
outstanding
trade
issues
there
are
obvious
problems
at
the
moment
in
the
trade
area
but
we
do
not
wish
those
problems
to
divert
attention
from
important
areas
of
cooperation
that
continue
to
exist
on
security
and
political
issues
he
said
the
question
is
whether
through
cooperative
actions
between
our

we
can
reduce
the
trade
imbalance
or
whether
congress
takes
action
to
reduce
it

tamura
referred

in

i
feel
this
is
a

on

to

through
expansion
while
i
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
the
trade
deficit
between
japan
and
the
ec
i
believe
it
should
be
rectified
not
by
reducing

by
expanding
the

the

not
specify
the

the

of

to
be
stimulated
however
top
ldp

will
work
out
figures
so
that
abe
will
be
able
to
offer
specifics
to
u

the
proposed
increase
in
procurement
of
foreign

by
the

will
probably
include
the

of

ldp

said
according
to
the

japan

also
strive

solve

the

the

spending

one

and
roughly
pct

according
to

all

direct
central

subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
amount
to
some
five
billion
dlrs
per

independent
estimates
put
total
subsidies
from
all
sources
as
high
as
billion
and
the
analysts
said
much
of
that
money
is
wasted
changing
tax
laws
to
encourage
city
residents
who
only
farm
on
weekends
to
put
their
land
up
for

for

would
also
give

japanese
business
groups
are
calling
for
staged
farm
reform
to
shift
some
of
the
burden
of
trade
friction
and
economic
restructuring
away
from
the
manufacturing
sector
and
onto
the
farm
sector
employers
groups
also
want
change
if
you
really
want
to
expand
domestic

the
way
to
do
it
is
not
to
raise
wages
recklessly
but
to
reduce
commodity
prices
bumpei
otsuki
president
of
the
japan
federation
of

associations
told
a
recent
press

external
pressures
are
rising
as
the
u

and
europe
seek
removal
of
tariffs
and
quotas
to
help
reduce
their
trade
deficits
with
japan
but
vested
japanese
interests
opposed
to
change
remain
well
entrenched
dimming
prospects
for
quick
reform
analysts
said
although
the
full
time
farm
population
is
falling
and
there
are
signs
the
ldp
is
paying
more
attention
to
urban
constituencies
the
ruling
party
remains
heavily
dependent
on
farm
votes
in
the
rural
areas
one
rural
vote
is
worth
several
city
votes
due
to
the
pattern
of
constituency
borders
the
ldp
is
already
in
political
trouble
over
its
tax
reform
plan
and
does
not
want
to
raise
another
sticky
issue
so
soon
the
analysts
said
consumer
groups
are
politically
weak
and
tend
to
accept
the

that
higher

powerful
agricultural

are
fiercely
opposed
to

liberalisation
but
are
more
flexible
about

they

when

nations
asean
they
could
no
longer
rely
on

to

given
the

you
clearly

he

shultz
told
the

the

would
cut
its

more

believed
he
said
asean
s
looming

would
not

stem

simply

to
make
in

to
service
our
large

growing

some

the

had
been
forced

the

said
it
believed
the

had
given
sufficient
elements
of
proof
for

warrant
an

which
could
lead
it
to

last

to
review
the

the

on
friday
to
propose
a
renunciation
of

to
the

body
gatt
unless
there
are
adequate
and
early

such
a

would
be
the

to
imposing
stiff

quantitative

the

said
it
was

the

would
be
discussed
in
detail
at
the
next

of

on

in

they

the

take
some

being
diverted
to

following

the

also
likely
to
discuss
how
to
prevent

getting

at

the

but
added
the

should
not
be
the
one
affected
by
the

he
said
the
causes
of
the
deficit
were
the
strong
dollar
and
the

deficit
and
it
is
regrettable
to
solve
it
by
a
trade
bill
that
would
only
serve
private
u

made
the
comment
at
a

after

last

hit
a

congressional

say
the

are
aimed
mainly
at
japan
taiwan
south

and
a
few
other

with
large

mexico
brazil

are
the
only
latin

with

last

with

even
mexico
with
the

had
a
surplus
of
only
billion
dlrs
against
japan
s
of

dlrs
the
european

has
also
opposed
the
bills
rodriguez
said
the
latin

nations
backed
the
reagan
administration
s
opposition
to
many
of
the
sections
in
the
legislation
including
those
to
curb
imports
and
to
require
retaliation
for
foreign
unfair
trade
practices
he
told

the

would
likely
mount
a
campaign
to
fight
the

when
it
comes
up
for
debate
on
the
senate
floor
expected
next

rodriguez
said
the
region
needs
trade
to
continue
development
we
hope
this
need
will
not
be
affected
negatively
by

rodriguez
said
we
need
to
keep
the
market
opens
especially
the
u

to
obtain
the
necessary

not

to
service
the

also

the

would
also
be
pressing
for
an
improvement
in

access
and
new
measures
to
ensure

do
not
erect

under

he
said
i
would
have
no
choice
but
to
veto
that

in

he
said
the
measure
would
move
us
exactly
in
the
wrong
direction
towards
high

april
a
top
u

official
said
japan
has
little
chance
of
persuading

to
drop
threatened

despite
the
efforts
of
a
japanese
team
that
left
for
washington
today
michael
armacost
under
secretary
of

for
political
affairs
was
asked
at
a
press
conference
whether
japan
s
moves
to
boost
its
domestic
economy
and
open
its
markets
could
persuade
the
u
s
not
to
impose
tariffs
on
japanese
imports
said
and
replied
it
is
probably
too
early
for
the
figures
to
demonstrate
that
the
situation
has
turned
around
and
to
permit
the
result
you
have
described
armacost
said
the
u
s
hopes
japan
will
take
steps
to
lift
its
domestic
economy
and
reduce
dependence
on
exports
remove
barriers
to
imports
and
settle
outstanding
trade
issues
there
are
obvious
problems
at
the
moment
in
the
trade
area
but
we
do
not
wish
those
problems
to
divert
attention
from
important
areas
of
cooperation
that
continue
to
exist
on
security
and
political
issues
he
said
the
question
is
whether
through
cooperative
actions
between
our
governments
we
can
reduce
the
trade
imbalance
or
whether
congress
takes
action
to
reduce
it
through

curb

washington

u

it
was
all
but
certain
president
reagan
would
go
ahead
today
and
impose
curbs
on
japanese
exports
as
planned
asked
in
a
television
interview
what
the
chance
was
for
reagan
to
cancel
the
scheduled
pct
tariffs
on
japanese
electronic
exports
he
said
slim
to
none
reagan
announced
on
march
he
would
impose
the
tariffs
to
retaliate
for
japan
s
failure
to
honor
a
agreement
to
end
dumping
computer
semiconductors
in
world
markets
at
less
than
cost
and
to
open
its
home
markets
to
u
s
products
yeutter
on
the
nbc
program
today
said
the
united
states
did
not
want
to
terminate
the
agreement
and
would
drop
the
tariffs
once
japan
began
fulfilling
the
agreement
he
said
japanese
negotiators
last
week
told
u
s
officials
they
were
honoring
the
pact
but
yeutter
said
it
would
take
time
to
monitor
any
compliance
asked
how
long
that
would
take
he
said
we
want
to
see
a
pattern
of
compliance
so
in
a
minimum
i
would
say
that
would
take
a
few
weeks
yeutter
said
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
much
consumer
impact
by
the
tariffs
on
mln
dlrs
worth
of
japanese
goods
because
the
items
selected
are
also
readily
available
from
other
countries
and
manufacturers
he
said
he
did
not
think
japan
would
retaliate
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
in
the
interests
of
either
country
to
get
in
an
escalating
conflict
the
japanese
understand
that
full
well
yeutter
said
he
added
japan
might
challenge
the
tariffs
in
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
gatt
but
that
s
more
of
a
paper
kind
of
exercise
and
i
don
t
really
expect
to
see
any
adverse
impact
on
u
s
trade
yeutter
also
said
he
did
not
see
any
way
the
semiconductor
issue
could
be
resolved
before
or
during
a
washington
visit
later
this
month
by
japanese
prime
minister
yasuhiro
nakasone
he
said
he
hoped
the
visit
which
is
to
have
trade
as
a
major
issue
would
be
productive
but
i
don
t
see
any
practical
way
to
resolve

particular

before

agreement
to
end
dumping
semiconductors
in
world
markets
at
less
than
cost
and
to
open
its
markets
to
u
s
products
the
tariffs
were
placed
on
items
which
were
available
from
other
sources
so
there
would
be
little
effect
on
the
american
consumer
fitzwater
said
reagan
has
come
under
heavy
pressure
to
take
tougher
action
especially
against
japan
to
end
global
unfair
trade
practices
and
reverse
the
growing
u
s
trade
deficit
the
alternative
was
that
if
he
did
not
congress
would
the
u
s
trade
gap
last
year
was
a
record
billion
dlrs
and
continues
to
rise
with
japan
accounting
for
about
one
third
of
america
s
overall
deficit
but
there
are
other
two
way
deficits
with
canada
west
germany
taiwan
and
south
korea
and
reagan
officials
said
the
president
is
ready
to
fight
them
all
reagan
said
in
announcing
the
sanctions
today
that
i
regret
that
these
actions
are
necessary
but
that
the
health
and
vitality
of
the
u
s
semiconductor
industry
was
essential
to
american
competitiveness
in
world
markets
we
cannot
allow
it
to
be
jeopardized
by
unfair
trading
practices
reagan
added
in
the
statement
from
his
california
vacation
home
at
santa
barbara
he
said
the
tariffs
would
remain
in
force
until
japan
abided
by
the
agreement
u
s
officials
say
the
action
today
will
show
congress
which
is
about
to
write
a
trade
bill
he
does
not
like
that
he
already
has
the
tools
needed
to
fight
unfair
trade
the
white
house
aide
said
of
the
tariff
action
it
wasn
t
done
to
appease
congress
but
because
there
was
an
unfair
trade
practice
the
aide
added
however
on
another
plane
it
was
an
example
of
how
the
administration
uses
the
trade
law
to
fight
unfair
practices
an
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
a
major
overall
of
our
trade
laws
but
the
analyst
crandall
said
the
tariff
action
was
not
in
the
best
interests
of
the
united
states
and
that
negotiations
should
have
been
pursued
to
resolve
the
issue
it
s
very
dangerous
to
go
down
the
retaliatory
route
he
said
because
it
leads
to
more
retaliation
and
restrictions
in
trade
crandall
said
the
administration
is
doing
this
for
its
political
impact
across
the
country
and
therefore
its
impact
on
congress
he
said
i
don
t
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
but
other
analysts
said
it
made
little
difference
whether
the
tariffs
were
aimed
at
u
s
trading
partners
or
congress
and
that
the
main
point
was
that
the
trading
partners
were
on
notice
that
retaliation
was
a
weapon
reagan
was
ready
to
use
spokesman
fitzwater
said
we
don
t
want
a
trade
war
but
the
imposition
of
sanctions
showed
the
united
states
would
act
when
it
had
evidence
that
trade
pacts
were
being
violated
